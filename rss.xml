&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&apos;s on arXiv! (written 10 June)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I spent half a year in Zurich at ETH, and in the second class of Ryan Cotterell’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://rycolab.io/classes/llm-s23/&quot;&gt;Large Language Models&lt;/a&gt; course I walked up to him to ask if he was looking for research assistants.
It has since been a year with several ups and downs, but today, we (meaning myself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://valvoda.github.io/&quot;&gt;Josef Valvoda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rycolab.io/authors/tianyu/&quot;&gt;Tianyu Liu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://anejsvete.github.io/&quot;&gt;Anej Svete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/&quot;&gt;Ryan Cotterell&lt;/a&gt;) put up a paper on arXiv, titled somewhat dramatically “A Fundamental Tradeoff in Aligned Language Models and its Relationship to Sampling Adaptors”.
You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10203&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre flight (written 1 Feb)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the last month, I&apos;ve spent so much time trying to meet and spend time with people I care about. Friends, family, extended family. I&apos;ve typically been incredibly introverted, so this has been quite an... interesting and refreshing experience. In fact, in the last three weeks, my daily routine has basically been lunch with someone, run some errands, dinner with someone, sleep, repeat. This month has also coincided with the Lunar New Year, so I&apos;ve also visited family and gone to Malaysia to visit my family there. It&apos;s been so busy.
&lt;p&gt;But it’s been so good! So many of these friends I’ve not seen in a while - we’re all busy, and myself, every since university has started, I can’t say I’ve really had any lull periods other than this month. So it’s been nice to spend time and catch up with many of these friends who I care for very deeply, and spend some time on myself recharging and reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am now, on the cusp on another great adventure. I’m kinda nervous, kinda excited. It’s 12.53pm as I write this, and I’m more or less packed, set to have dinner with two close friends and then off I am on a flight to Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably feels like a bigger deal than it is because many of my friends are graduating before I am (they study 4 years, I study 5) and are going abroad for grad school - so for many of them I won’t see for maybe a year and a half or so, maybe more. I’m happy and excited for all of these people - they are talented, intelligent and down-to-earth people who will do great things; I’ll just miss them, is all. And I think I’ll look back on and occasionally miss the simpler times. After all, in year 1 and 2 of university, everyone stayed on campus, hung out regularly, and the greatest worry we had were our grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m back, a lot of things will be different, I think. I’d have completed a semester at ETH, worked at Palantir, most of my friends would be abroad and/or graduated, and I imagine I, too, would have seen some change and growth. I’m equally scared and excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 more hours till I’m on that plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;First three days (written 5 Feb)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So far, Zurich is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it here. People are nice, public transport is great, I generally feel safe. The city centre is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 24 hours have been focused on &lt;strong&gt;buying stuff&lt;/strong&gt;, because god, my room was really barebones, and there’s so much minute overhead to just living, lol. Been to Ikea and carried a bunch of stuff back, been to a couple supermarkets and done the same, and I’m almost done. Just left with some small quality-of-life purchases like a drying rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1: landed, got a SIM card, rail pass, checked in, bought some groceries, went to ikea, made some friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2: went to the city centre with some friends, spent a ton of time walking around, had sandwich, some famous hot chocolate, saw a cool church and some great views of the river, hit a big supermarket, and cooked my first meal. Made more friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 3: chatted with new people over breakfast. Went to the city centre for a tour. Made friends with people on said tour, and spent basically the whole day with them. Went back, made dinner (very bad yakisoba attempt, it’s so hard without the right ingredients ._.), had some nice conversations and made more new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired, but so far, so good. I hope I’ll continue to make friends and do cool things. Tomorrow, is my first German class. Fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 14th day (written 16 Feb)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I have been on Swiss soil for 14 days now. Life is going pretty well - I’ve settled in quite nicely I think. It’s gone by &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt; though. In the last week or so I’ve completed German 1 (it’s 3 x 2 hours a day, every day) which fulfils the first half of A1 German, climbed my first hill (the Swiss call it a molehill, but to my Singaporean mind the hike was tall), cooked my first rack of lamb for valentine’s day (my girlfriend was kind enough to visit me from London), watched my first movie abroad (Swiss tickets are 17 CHF, and they have intermissions!) and got very cold a lot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been very good, but very exhausting. Moving abroad and setting up a comfortable (if temporary) “home”, doing 6 hours of high-intensity language learning daily and packing my schedule to spend time with my girlfriend while she’s visiting is pretty tough. Switzerland is beautiful though, and people here are generally very welcoming. And thank god for the fact that most people speak English - I’d have such a tough time otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today in particular, my girlfriend has headed back to London, and I’m alone here. In the coming week, it’s a bunch of admin and welcome events, the start of lessons and presumably a bunch of socializing and a return to using my brain after a month-long break. I’m really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year feels like it’s shaping up to be a pretty good year, and I have a lot of things to look forward to. Fingers crossed next week is a good week, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;First week of school  (written 25 Feb)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A very quick week of school has passed. The classes have been awesome. They&apos;re really hard, generally pretty rigorous and the profs are exceptionally good at explaining stuff.
&lt;p&gt;Can’t help start to feel lonely, though. Moving abroad isn’t quite as rosey as it’s painted back home, I suppose. The exchange coordinator in our briefing did mention that this tends to happen - you start off all excited because everything is new, at some point get tired and homesick, and then eventually adjust. I suppose I’m trending just like the average person - which gives me some comfort, because I know things will get better :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;A month in and some reflections (written 8 March)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered the country on the 2nd of February. Today, it’s a Wednesday, on the 8th of March. I’ve been meaning to find some time to sit and write, but the semester is starting to get busy. But I have a bit of time today - mostly because I’m sick and decided to take it easy (it’s not easy getting better in a cold, dry country), so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. My classes/research: generally, great!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reading four classes this semester:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch//Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=171001&amp;#x26;semkez=2023S&amp;#x26;ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&amp;#x26;lang=en&quot;&gt;263-5354-00L Large Language Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://disco.ethz.ch/courses/podc/&quot;&gt;227-0558-00L Principles of Distributed Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch//Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?semkez=2018S&amp;#x26;ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&amp;#x26;lerneinheitId=122559&amp;#x26;lang=de&quot;&gt;252-0341-01L Information Retrieval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch//lerneinheitPre.do?semkez=2018S&amp;#x26;lerneinheitId=119949&amp;#x26;lang=en&quot;&gt;363-1000-00L Financial Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I choose these four classes? Well, as a non-German speaking dude, my options at ETH are limited to Masters-level courses that are taught in English, so that limits my pool. I also came to ETH with the explicit goal of challenging myself and taking interesting, hard courses that deepen my knowledge of deep learning/ML engineering and its adjacent fields. The first three courses fit that bill very naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why financial economics, then? Well, I ask myself that too. I have absolutely zero interest. It’s a practical matter - I’m four economics electives away from completing my second degree in economics. Clearing one abroad helps to reduce my course load when I go home. It is the only map-able economics module I can do here. So, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I love the courses generally, and I think I’ve got an interesting spectrum down. PODC and IR are taught similarly to higher-level bachelor’s courses - the course is structured, well thought out and generally it’s an information dump, if that makes sense. They teach me new things, I learn new things, I do practice, I take the exam. All fine and dandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLMs… it’s a new course. The lecturer is literally writing the textbook as the course progresses. So that can be a little jarring at times. Add that to the fact that tutorials are also being written as they go, there’s… not much structure. And yet, the content is extremely refreshing, and it really does feel like it’s on the cutting edge of research - to my knowledge, Ryan’s work is one of the first to provide such a comprehensive formal description of language models. So that (in my opinion) makes up for its drawbacks. It’s pretty hard and heavy though - it’s like 90 pages of proof-heavy readings per week, which can sometimes be unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial economics. Not a fan. But I’ll get through it. I haven’t attended a single lecture, lol. But I’m reasonably certain I can self study, because the lecture slides, textbook chapters and tutorials have been released, and I’ve been consistent with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also working on a research project with I2R back home (remotely) and in person here with Dr. Ryan’s lab. It’s a bit busy, but the topics - multimodal engagement detection, and explainable evaluation for large language models - are exciting and tickle my brain. I’m excited to work on them! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Living abroad, more generally: pros, cons, and I think I’m okay with it - just okay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what it’s like in other countries - and I suspect it’s different because of the relative sizes of other countries - but in Singapore, being able to go abroad seems like a big thing. When someone says that they’re going abroad to study or work, they are often met with “wows” and “congratulations”. It’s some sort of a medium-to-big deal. My peers have faced that, and I too have. A related phenomenon is a general desire to emigrate and leave - you can see it &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypeandstuff.com/why-i-chose-to-leave-singapore/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-want-to-leave-Singapore&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/p1iz2d/exsingaporean_what_made_you_leave_singapore_i_can/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, amongst the many other articles and forum posts about it within the Singapore context. And it’s an interesting contrast to what immigrants often think about Singapore, which seems to bounce between the extremes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Is-Singapore-an-authoritarian-government&quot;&gt;authoritarian dystopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;a great place&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a strange feeling, then, to be on this side of the discussion and experience what it’s like to live abroad for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, anyway, I think life is pretty good back home. Not to say that there aren’t flaws, and not to say that the relative privilege of my upbringing has not influenced that, but life here is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes in good ways, and sometimes not so much. I love the weather here, how people generally have a greater respect for and focus on living a good life (even if, for example, the financial decisions they make make me squirm), and how people seem to have a wider perspective of the region. I think some of it comes from the rich history and varied geography of the region - Europe is so incredibly heterogeneous, and so much immigration and free movement, I suppose, is bound to create this. I like a lot of these things, and I think Singapore and Singaporeans can do better on a lot of them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are too, things I like less. So far, they are mostly practical things - safety and social responsibility, the inconvenience that comes with good labour practices (e.g. everything closes on Sunday - everything) and larger spaces. The less practical things, I think they are subjective, and I have my own preferences - some fit better than others to my lifestyle and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a bit of an unstructured ramble, but what I’m trying to express is this feeling of being out of place that I suppose all immigrants experience, and this feeling of being ungrounded as I learn about this new environment. And also this feeling of having new, fresh ideas that I think can and arguably should be done back home, as well as feelings of gratitude for how things are back home. I find myself - more often than expected - going “we do it better back home”, and that gives me a tiny tingling of pride to be a Singaporean. Kinda like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mothership.sg/2023/02/young-singaporeans-living-overseas/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; loosely captures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my friends will probably disagree with me - some of them have described their 6 months or 3 years or however long abroad as “the best time of their life” or how x city was the “best city they’ve ever lived in”. But that’s fine. My opinion will probably evolve as I get more settled - I have after all only spent about 5 weeks here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have unfortunately fallen sick this week, but I hope next week will be better :D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Travelling is expensive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve been to Liechtenstein, Bern (Switzerland), and I’m heading to London this weekend to visit my girlfriend. We’re also planning trips to Paris, Florence, Naples, and Rome. Maybe it’s the penny pincher in me, but god, this hurts my wallet so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this to a lot of people - to me, the “once in a lifetime” perspective to me is a little misconstrued - what’s “once in a lifetime” is the opportunity to study at one of the world’s top schools, to live abroad, to be independent. I can always come back to Europe. But I suppose it doesn’t hurt to see the world a little, even as a tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, till the next time I have some time to reflect and log. But I think it’s going to be a hectic 6 weeks ahead - lots of studying, lots of research, lots of travel. With a little bit of luck, the weather will be good, I will stay healthy and generally have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back from London, down with COVID (written 18 March) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for hoping for the weeks ahead for good health. Life can be funny. Anyway, I’m down with COVID. So, that constrains me to my room, mostly. That’s good for the introvert in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tore my MCL, went to Italy over Easter anyway... and I&apos;m now headed home (written 14 April) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a very hectic two weeks. In the last month or so I’ve intimately experienced the Swiss healthcare system (honestly, it’s pretty good) because I tore my MCL playing badminton. But, my tickets to Italy over Easter were bought and non-refundable, so after several hospital visits and frantic replanning, we went to Rome and Florence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very solid (if exhausting) trip. Tomorrow, I head back to Singapore because I need to apply for my visa (for London) from Singapore - it’s a little bit annoying. But it’ll be nice to be home for a bit I think. I’m starting to get a little homesick, so this comes at a nice time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck, because I need to be studying &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; while dealing with my leg and jet lag. I’m very behind on my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back in Zurich, but headed off soon (written 12 May) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, the last month has flown by. Felt like I’ve barely had any time just to decompress and relax. But today, I have a small pocket as I wait for my recorded lecture to be published, so here I am instead. In the three weeks I was home, some stuff happened, and I think taking some time to reflect on them is interesting, and some of these thoughts are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going home did not taste as sweet as I expected it to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks prior to heading home, I’d actually begun to feel homesick. My experience abroad had been almost exactly as the briefing had mentioned - you start off excited, start to feel homesick, before getting better and eventually stabilising. I’d been a bit homesick and was generally on the up, but I thought that going home would be nice. It was, but it also wasn’t quite as sweet as I thought it’d be. Going back to familiarity was nice - I was so excited on that ride home from Changi to sit at my desk, sleep on my bed, eat familiar food - the feelings that I’d missed the most. Those feelings, however, were fleeting. I sat down, I ate, I slept. And then day 2 was just like any other day in Singapore. Was a little anticlimatic, in truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting feeling. Perhaps that’s what some of my more well-traveled or studying-abroad peers and relatives mean when they say they don’t really miss home. Because perhaps I didn’t, either - I just missed not feeling out-of-place, and in Zurich, I often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big decision was made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to drop my second degree in economics. It came after a good chat with my partner. I think it’s the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I stayed on a European time zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, going backwards in time from Singapore to Europe is much easier to adapt to than the other way around. I find it that way, anyway. Going to Europe is like sleeping late and then messing up your sleep schedule. Which isn’t hard. Coming home is like fixing it. Which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hard. So for my first 7 days at home, I slept at 4 and woke at 11. Was an interesting experience eating &lt;em&gt;dinner&lt;/em&gt; at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man, Singapore really has so many skyscrapers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in Zurich is interesting because there’s virtually no tall buildings. I’d (without noticing it) gotten used to seeing the sky all the time, wherever I was. The sky here, is so blue, so often, too. When I went home, I spent some time at Telok Ayer, and had this moment where I felt a subtle sense of confusion that I couldn’t place. It was because I couldn’t really see the sky without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich is nice. Too bad it’s so far from home, and I’m neither German/German-speaking nor an EU citizen. And my partner is not Swiss. Maybe I’ll be back one day, but probably only if Swiss immigration laws relax or I somehow achieve so much that they can justify giving me a work visa. We’ll see. It’s a nice place to be. Feels lot like the Singapore of Europe - ridiculously, painfully expensive, but things generally work and make sense. If I ever consider moving, I think Zurich will certainly be on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It felt like a time skip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such an interesting experience coming home and almost experiencing something like a time skip. When you’re away, the people you care about continue living - life goes on. So when I come home and we talk, it feels… strange sometimes. It’s not the lack of familiarity, but just a strange lack of context to feelings and emotions of my friends and family that I find myself having to go “oh, what happened” or “oh, what do you mean”. Kinda interesting to feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note is conversations that are somewhat one-sided in that they have 1984713946 things to tell you, and normally, distrbuted over a couple months, the points they raise sound sane and make sense. All at once, they get overwhelming. The best example of this I got was “are y’all gonna get married?“. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is leaving, and I feel a little sad about that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing unique to this experience of mine, I suppose, is that I’m in my fourth year of university. All my friends are, too - and they’re graduating, but I’m not. I can’t help but feel a little sad that we can’t have that “last semester” experience together, or graduate together and take nice graduation pictures. It also doesn’t help that as I reflected on all those months ago - many of these friends are going abroad for grad school, and I won’t be seeing them for a while. Some of them, I think, I won’t see for an extra-long while, because they don’t hope to come back. So there’s that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two weeks left before London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m back in Zurich now. It feels bittersweet that I only have two weeks left here - the friends I’ve made, while not deep, have been wonderful, and how I wish we could continue being in each other’s lives. It’s been nice knowing them, though, and for many of them I hope we stay in touch. It’d be a shame not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does feel like an exciting time, though. My leg is healing quite nicely, in two weeks I’ll be in London - for all its cosmopolitan shit-hole-ness, I also grew up in a city, and it’s nice to be in one, sometimes. And in four weeks, I’ll get started at Palantir - and from the material they’ve shared with us, I’m really excited to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;About to leave Zurich (written 19 May)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning, I leave for London. In the short amount of time I’ve spent here, I’ve gotten to know a surprising number of people pretty well. It’s a bit sad to go - to think that tomorrow, it’ll be a long while before I get to see some of these people again. But I suppose that’s the nature of these exchanges. It’s on me, and on them, I guess, to keep these ties alive. To visit and check in on each other every so often. I hope I’ll keep up my end of the deal. And plus, I suppose, it isn’t quite over - I’m going to be back in Zurich for 2 days for my final exams in late August. By then, many of them would have gone home - but for the few who haven’t, I think it’d be nice to grab lunch and catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, tomorrow is the start of a new chapter. I will try my best to be excited for it and keep my eyes on that. New challenges, new people, new things to work on. And if it is just half as good as my experience in Zurich, it’s going to be great. I hope it’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to miss Zurich. I’m going to miss Zurich a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&apos;m now in London! (written 26 May)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is a bit more of a shithole compared to Zurich, but it’s so much more… vibrant? I get so many more “how are you’s” and random conversations with strangers, and it almost feels as if everyone has this big dream or weird side project or gig or hustle or whatever. It’s… interesting. I kinda like it. Summer extending nightfall to like 10pm also helps with the whole safety thing, I think. Messes with my sleep schedule, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting my own place, while a natural extension to staying in school-provided accomadation (as in Singapore, or in Zurich), feels so different. So much more responsibility, less benefits from scale (we clean everything ourselves, more expensive), but also so much more private. It feels kinda cool, actually. This new flat, while superbly located in the city centre, was in an absolutely filthy state when I moved in. Have you ever mopped a floor &lt;em&gt;16 times and it’s still dirty??&lt;/em&gt; But with great thanks to my room mate for sticking through it with me, we’ve cleaned up the place real nice, and I think we’ve settled in pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit of a shame by partner and I couldn’t both find jobs here, because man, wouldn’t that just be so cool to do together? She did help me move in, though, and I helped her move out - she’s headed to New Haven for an internship, too. It was nice to have that little overlap in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week: a quick trip to Amsterdam, lots of studying, and then my first week of work the week after that! I’m really excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Went to Amsterdam. Also, first week of work starts tomorrow (written 4 June)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam was an interesting and eye-opening (albeit exhausting) experience. My journey to Amsterdam began eventfully - my ride to the airport involved multiple train delays, my flight was delayed over an hour, and then I was almost kicked off said flight because it was overbooked. An on arrival, between visiting the red-light district, the constant smell of weed and the general degree of positivity and openess, I found Amsterdam eye-opening. It was pretty fun, too, in no small part because the city really has some really interesting sights and great food. My trip home was equally bumpy - it took me a total of 8 hours to get home. My hour long flight was bookended by a flight delay before departure, and a mix of hitch-hiking, cab-splitting and a long uber ride home on arrival as national rail strikes across the UK left me with no train home and competing with literally everyone else at that airport for a ride home. It was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since coming back, I’ve spent some time just &lt;em&gt;recovering&lt;/em&gt;, doing some studying and looking after myself. Oh, and Manchester United lost the FA cup final. Tonight, I watch Spiderverse 2, and tomorrow, I start work. I’m excited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two weeks in, kinda drowning, trying to float (written 21 June)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very quickly, two and a half weeks have flown by. I have been onboarded, introduced to my team, and as of today, I’ve merged a small handful of PRs. It’s been tough. The first week wasn’t much - a ton of introductory material and socials, but it was really manageable. As expected, I guess. But the second week, the last 10 days, have been tough. A big company’s code base is miles apart from a plucky startup - layers, layers and more layers of abstraction, a horrific amount of tooling, and outdated (and often non-existent) documentation. The level of talent here is also higher, I think - where in other organizations I’ve typically, honestly, coasted by putting in 60-70% effort, here I’m barely keeping up putting in my all. Last week in particular, was really tough, because I felt frustrating unproductive, guiltily-burdensome and probably the stupidest I’ve felt in a long time. I’ve never thought of myself as an excellent developer, just maybe slighty above the average, but the last week has made me felt like I’m in the botto of the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, I found myself feeling overwhelmed and absolutely spent. So I took some quiet time (a very rare thing these days - so many meetings!) to reflect. And my thoughts can essentially be summarized as: don’t freeze, keep your ego at the door, ask lots of questions (shamelessly), be careful/polish your work more (I got 50+ comments on my first PR, lol). And this week, I’ve put a lot time into exactly those things - asking questions to unblock myself, trying to be careful with my work, and well, just not giving up. Today was - in the words of my friend Karlo, a fellow intern - the first day I’ve not felt like an absolute failure. He, too, like many of the other interns, has been struggling. It might sound dramatic, exaggerated - and it is - but I think it captures that feeling of exasperation and your ego being swiftly crushed by a new and unfamilliar challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m quite out of the woods yet - but fingers crossed the rest of the week is just as not-bad, and may god help me with managing my studies and final year thesis on top of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&apos;m so exhausted! (written 22 July)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a month, since then. Many ups and downs, I think. The good: I’m picking things up relatively well, my quality of work has been improving slowly but steadily, and I’m integrating quite nicely into the team. Some highlights: going go karting with the team and doing a fun little presentation we call hashtags (where you share topical things about yourself). The not so good: I can do better, and things are very busy at work. The bad: managing work alongside research ands studying for three exams is rough. I’ve more or less not had a single day that I’ve worked (as in, worked, worked on research, or studied) less than 12 hours since being to London. And I’m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a break this evening, and I think I might just take some time off tomorrow to take a rest. I think I’m burning out, and I think I need that break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an exam next Saturday, another one the Tuesday the week after that, and another one in Zurich at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying my best to float! Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details closed&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back in Zurich for my final exam (written 25 August)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m back in Zurich. About 11 hours ago, I finished my last exam for the semester, and with that, marked the end of what has been a very long (and fun, but definitely long) 8 months studying and working. After which, I rewarded myself with some strawberries and popped by the ETH AI Center to visit my thesis supervisor. I’ll be working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cimeister.github.io/&quot;&gt;Clara Meister&lt;/a&gt;, who is a fantastic supervisor and generally awesome person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then spent the rest of the day chilling at a cafe and walking around Zurich, because it’ll probably be a while before I’m back. Zurich is pretty great, and I’ll miss it. Landing at the airport three days ago felt like a breath of fresh air - suddenly all was clean, functional, safe, and generally just… good - except the weather. Zurich had a heat wave and reached 35C for a couple days. And the last two days, despite crashing on a couch of a friend (who really hasn’t taken good care of her apartment, lol), it has been really nice being back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I head off to Basel to begin a 5 day holiday with a friend around Switzerland and France. I’m really looking forward to this break. I’ve been working myself pretty hard for the last couple months, and I kinda need these few days just to rot and relax. Take stock. Before, of course, going back to the grind - application season is opening, as are grad school applications. I’m a little anxious about those, but I’m sure I’ll manage it fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably spend some time at the end of all of this writing a bit more about my 8 months abroad. But the big TL;DR of it - it’s been hard, so, so much harder than I thought it would be, but also so much more enriching and worth it than I thought it would be, too. It’s been a good 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&apos;m home (written 9 September)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been back for a week. Between the jet lag, scurrying around meeting old friends and getting my shit together for school and application season, it’s been a pretty busy week, and I haven’t quite had the time to reflect upon the past 8 months aborad. There are a lot of feelings and thoughts, and I’ll probably go through them at a later date. Especially because I’m starting my internship at Apple on Monday, and application season is upon us. But while things are busy (and only going to get more so), the warm weather - while sometimes insufferable - agrees with me. The food is familiar. My friends and family are here. I’m glad to be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My chapter abroad is now closed. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

But also, as part of my general belief that taking the unconventional path is okay, too, I’m writing this to document my thoughts for the unlikely someone who, too, is travelling the road less travelled. Hopefully, there’s some value in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I’ve decided to drop my second degree in economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a funny thing studying a double degree. Opening conversations often include a moment of confusion when they realize I’m in my fourth year, but also somehow still not graduating. You can almost see them trying to work out if some weird combination of NS, poly/JC/international school could somehow have led to this (you know that meme with the lady calculating stuff in her head?). Sometimes I also throw in the fact that I’m 23 (I’m male, and did not do NS, for context) just to see how they react, and sometimes it’s pretty funny. I’ve always laughed it off though, because it’s just a funny quirk of doing a double degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, though, I made a new acquaintance. And for the first time in four years, my explanation was simply that I’m taking a little longer to graduate. It feels strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I wanted a second degree in economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; defines the field to be “a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree more with the second line, though - “Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always understood Economics to be the study of how things interact at scale. Micro, macro and metrics are the umbrella fields that respectively study how systems operate at the level of &lt;em&gt;markets&lt;/em&gt;, how they do so at the level of &lt;em&gt;economies&lt;/em&gt; (many markets aggregated) and how we can confirm these theories empirically. Utility maximisation, risk sharing schemes, game theory, the 134807340 regressions we learn - are all just different ways of trying to understand why people behave the way they do. And for that reason, I find economics fascinating and comforting, because it serves as my lens to understand what often feels like a very chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond understanding how things worked for its practicalities, I also wanted to study economics to understand how the systems around me worked and failed. At 18, it felt like a lot of things were wrong with the world and I wanted to do my part fixing it. I felt like I had the drive and energy to do something good, in no small part probably fueled by youthful idealism. But also, at the &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; age of 18, the world felt noisy, chaotic and overwhelming, and I wanted a way to study it systematically. Coming across economics at JC felt exactly like what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things have changed, though&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who hears me talk about my work these days, though, will probably hear a lot about machine learning, backend engineering, something I’m working on in my research, some cool algorithm or theorem or proof I came across. It is very unlikely one would hear me talk about anything I learnt in economics. And perhaps that’s precisely reflective of where I’m at these days, and where I’m headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as it is with everyone “going through uni”, I’ve hit a few milestones that have changed where I see myself headed and what I care about. Where I was once deeply driven to join the public service and almost (idealistically) prepared to sacrifice a lot in service of that goal, I find myself much more pragmatic and focused these days. It’s not quite the firey mantra of “I want to do good work” as it is more of “this is pretty neat, I enjoy it, and it pays me pretty okay, so let’s do that”. Having a partner who I’m serious about also makes me conscious of where I’m putting my time and energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, this is a decision that I’ve been kicking down the road for a while, and I’ve reached the point where I can’t do so anymore. Every semester, my friends will attest to me saying the phrase “I feel like I’ve found my limit this semester”. That’s in part because I almost always have some “thing” going on, like being a TA or doing research, but it’s largely because taking 6-7 classes a semester - a natural byproduct of studying a double degree - isn’t easy. Well, at least, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don’t find it easy. Every semester since 2021 I’ve questioned my own motivations in reading a second degree and the feasibility of my study plan that apparently entails 225 MCs despite going on exchange (where typically, you’re forced to underload). But everytime after the semester ends, I go “well, I’ll decide when I have to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now at the point where I have to decide, because I have a few opportunities I’ve fortunately been presented with, but I literally cannot find it in me to take on all of them. I’m currently on exchange at ETH Zurich, which does not offer economics modules. I was also fortunately offered internship positions at Palantir and Apple. I see enough value in all three of these experiences - professionally and personally - to want all of these. But something has to give - because having another internship and completing another 37MCs (of which 12 is my FYP) in the next year, while working for 6 months of that year, is a no-no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for me, it’s my second degree in economics, because it unfortunately gives me no value beyond “this is fun to study”. I enjoy studying both my degrees. But studying CS has also given me a set of skills and fortunate opportunities to build stuff - things that interface with other things, every day, every moment, to &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt;. My pursuit of economics hasn’t quite borne the same fruit - I suppose neither could I or should I have expected it to; I’ve just realized that the fruit I want to pursue is knowing how to build stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sunk cost fallacy is hard and here’s my way of dealing with it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great barrier to making this choice for a while, beyond obviously losing the opportunity to study something I like, is sunk cost fallacy. And I’m sure anyone who’s put their heart into the pursuit of a goal can understand the feeling of bitterness that comes with having to give it up. “I’ve studied so hard for this, and I’m so close” has kept me going more than I can count. It sounds silly to say it out loud, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my partner, I decided to look back on 1. just how close I am and 2. how hard I’ve studied for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How close am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted a second honours degree, I’d be 6 classes and a thesis away. Without honours, it’d be 4 classes. That’s a lot of classes for 2 semesters with my CS courses, much less for 1 semester (if I don’t extend my candidature and LOA to work at Apple). So, I’m not that close. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How hard have I studied for this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest thing to look at is how much time I’ve spent on it, and a good proxy is the number of courses I’ve completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my time at NUS, I’ve taken 47 courses. Only 9 of which have been economics-specific. If you count the math modules, that’s another 3 classes. So that’s a total of 12. The 9 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC1101E Introduction to economic analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC2101 Microeconomics 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC2102 Macroeconomics 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC2204 Accounting for economists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC3101 Microeconomics 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC3102 Macroeconomics 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC3303 Econometrics 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC3304 Econometrics 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC3333 Financial economics 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, I’ve taken 8 (11 if you count math) mechanical engineering classes, and a whopping 17 CS courses (21 if you count math).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve definitely invested a non-trivial amount of time into it - I’ve completed enough classes to complete a second major - it’s hard to call myself a &lt;em&gt;double degree&lt;/em&gt; student, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going a step further to look at my semester schedules in the last four years, it becomes apparent to me that I’ve very slowly - like the frog that boils in gradually-getting-hotter water without realizing - been letting go of that pipe dream of being a civil servant that did some really good and meaningful work, because I’ve invested most of my time and energies studying computer science. To say that I’ve decided to drop my pursuit of a degree in economics isn’t quite accurate, because if you look at what I did and not what I or my records said, I’ve actually kinda already dropped it. It’s almost like I (unknowingly) quiet quit economics a while back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, 9 courses is not something to laugh at - it’s enough to complete a second major in economics after all. I’ve studied enough of it to give me a rudimentary appreciation for how things work, some useful mental models to think about the world around me, and I’d like to think I will not sound like a complete idiot to the average person (but I probably would sound like an idiot to any real economist out there). And perhaps, that has to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, what now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, tomorrow, I send the email to the department to officially drop my second degree. I doubt I’ll feel significantly different. But, I already feel lighter at the thought of having only my FYP to worry about in my last semester, and I feel at peace with this choice - especially because it feels like I can now whole-ass one thing, rather than half-ass two things. I think it’s the right choice. If it’s not, I guess I’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I continue with my studies on exchange at ETH, and very soon I’ll be headed to London on an exciting next chapter :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teaching CS2040 and CS3244 was not quite what I expected]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last semester, I signed up to TA for CS2040 and CS3244.

For those unfamiliar with those courses - CS2040 is a data structures and algorithms course for non-computing students, and CS3244 is a class on machine learning. The former is notorious for being challenging for non-computing students, while the latter has a reputation for being a little too touch-and-go in terms of how it teaches content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like classes on algorithms - I think they teach me very clever and often elegant ways of solving new problems I have often never seen, and in particular I think they simply expand the way I see things. I’m not very good at algorithms though - neither CS2040S nor later, CS3230 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms, a more advanced algorithms class) came easy to me. But I had the fortune of experiencing the teaching of some pretty good TAs, and wanted to pay it forward. This blog post in particular is inspired by one of those TAs - Christopher, the then head TA for CS3230. He was not my TA, but my TA was bad, and his sessions were recorded, and his classes helped me to get through the module. He wrote about his experience teaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisjwelly.github.io/blog/2022/01/05/Career-Progression-CS3230-TA/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it’s worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like machine learning. I mean, I used to study mechanical engineering, and it was my exposure to machine learning that convinced to change my course and throw myself into it. I think it’s kinda incredible how some clever linear algebra and statistics can basically spit out magic. I’ve actually never taken CS3244 - in fact, my journey in machine learning has been a little unconventional, as most of it is self-learnt. It began with EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning. But it was on-the-job at DSO as a machine learning engineer where I learnt about deep learning models and how to build them. And then on-the-job at the Institute of Data Science with a not-very-successful research project with Dr. Wynne Hsu where I learnt about NLP and graph machine learning, in part by completing Stanford online’s free CS224N and CS224W courses on NLP and graph machine learning. Then I would take CS4243 Computer Vision at NUS to, as I put it, “get some formal training”. And then it would be back to on-the-job learning at Hypotenuse AI, where I threw myself into large language models, vision-language and generative models in three very intensive months of work. I consider myself to have a slightly-above-average amount of experience in machine learning, but having never taken the class, I was still slightly surprised when I was accepted to be a TA for CS3244. Granted though, I wouldn’t be teaching a class, but instead helping out with the projects, grading and question-setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was being a TA for two courses a good idea alongside a course load of 4 modules, one of which is the notorious CS3203 Software Engineering Project? In hindsight, yes and no - yes because I’ve always wanted to TA, and Y4S1 was as close as it would ever get to me having the bandwith to TA. But also no, because it was honestly not easy to juggle everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to be a good TA is harder than I thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best TA’s I’ve gotten have really focused on building intuition, motivating seemingly-arbitrary things and pointing out common mistakes and pitfalls. I too, wanted to do that in my teaching. Before every class, I’d try prepare a recap of the week’s topics and pick up on areas I thought the lecture didn’t do well. I’d also run through and try to solve the tutorial questions on my own - so imagine my sense of shame when it’d take me longer than I’d like to admit to solve them, or when I’d get lazy and just look at the answer key. Imagine my initial sense of surprise and later dread towards these prep sessions too, when I realized that preparing for each class would take me around 1-2 hours in a very busy semester. My teaching style, especially at the start, was also very whiteboard-y, as in, I used an ipad to draw stuff out. Some students liked that, some didn’t, and I slowly found my equilibrium between the two only in the later parts of the semester. Sorry kids, I wish I was better at this. You can see my slides &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I would find out, preparing for class and then delivering it are also very different things. In fact, a consistent pattern I noticed in the two consecutive 9-10am and 10-11am classes I taught were that the 10-11am class would get far better version of my class. The early-risers were punished for being my guinea pigs. Despite “rehearsing” the night before, I would often stumble in the first class when a question I didn’t expect or had thought through prior to class came up, or when I realized my explanation wasn’t quite hitting the mark, or when I realized &lt;em&gt;halfway through the class&lt;/em&gt; that my explanation was not quite correct. I’m not great at improvising on the spot, but I tried my best to be honest with my class when I made a mistake or when I wasn’t quite teaching the content as well as I’d hoped, and they were generally very understanding about it. The second class almost had no such experience. Interestingly though, in the test statistics, my earlier class generally did better. Fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as the semester went on, I got better at preparing for class and anticipating questions, and as with most things, presenting content to a class gets better with practice, and classes were generally smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being a project mentor is also kinda hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CS2040, I was a tutorial teacher. For CS3244, I was a project mentor (amidst some other administrative responsibilities) - and that entailed meeting with project groups, giving them technical advice and grading their work (without them knowing). I had expected it to mean they would come prepared with questions, give me consistent updates, and I’d simply tell them this or that and it’d be a relatively easy $40 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think students kinda exist on a spectrum, and it’s no different for CS3244. I got some excellent, self-motivated, well-organized students who surpassed my expectations, and equally I also got some who… shall we say, needed more hand-holding and drama-management. It was interesting to see, and to see it as someone who had the authority to arbitrate conflicts, award exceptional work, or appropriately credit mediocre ones. It felt strange, sometimes cruel even, but I tried my best, and I hope my students never felt like I was leaving them out to dry or too harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting questions is really fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing out of CS3244 was me being able to set finals questions. It was so fun. This one did not make it to the final, so I can share it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I don’t like admin and students harrass you, lol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three more-memorable pieces of advice I got from some of my friends with TA experience when I told them I was about to TA for these classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give students your telegram handle/phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the TA you wish you had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students create more drama than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three turned out to be pretty good pieces of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 1: I got so, so many messages. I still tried my best to answer them, but I joke with some of my friends that maybe that’s why some courses use Microsoft Teams as a channel for questions - no one uses Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2: I got a lot more satisfaction, and I think my students generally appreciated it. It also shows in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMUM9bcACHBIcd0fDim4fqCXZtHJUVfA/view?usp=share_link&quot;&gt;teaching feedback&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m pretty happy about.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 3: Yea… You just gotta manage it fairly and consistently, I guess. I tried my best not to be too harsh, but sometimes I had to put my foot down. I’m a bit of a softie, and this was tricky for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, admin things like grading and invigilation really suck, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Would I TA again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could, I would. In part because after reading my feedback, I’d like to do better - for example, I got interesting feedback - female students tended to enjoy or benefit from my classes less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think for the remaining part of my educational journey at NUS, it’s going to be tricky to. So I probably won’t. Maybe if I ever go to grad school, I just might.

&lt;p&gt;Just about two years ago, it was the January of 2021. I got an email from the School of Computing, indicating that my
application to transfer my course of study to Computer Science had been successful. I distinctly recall the moment -
I was at the robotics lab with my team, working on the gimbal mechanism for the Standard Robot. It had been a pretty good day actually - development was going well and we had a good amount of momentum going. I also recall that it was the third round of ModReg - for the uninitiated, ModReg is the module registration system at NUS, and having 0 modules registered in the third round usually spells death - and it was the exact situation I was in, given that I had now been newly promoted to a Computer Science major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as I would learn is a very common thing in the School of Computing, I reached out to what might as well be the fairy godmother of all of us - Ms Toh Mui Kiat, and she sorted me out with some of the most important fundamental classes in CS - OOP, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization, Probability and Statistics - all classes I would come to love (and hate at times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That semester would begin what has been the very wild, often times wonderful, but equally frequently emotionally, mentally and physically challenging journey that I have been on for the last two years. But it’s been a good two years, and I figured I want to reflect on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I joined mechanical engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to go further back than two years ago for this. Back in 2019, I matriculated as a double degree student in mechanical engineering and economics. Why mechanical engineering? Well, it was sorta related to why economics as well. In much of my teens, I - and I suspect a good number of my peers at the time, too - was very idealistic and going through my own struggles with my health and in school. And this idealism manifested itself as a deep desire to do something somehow so great that it would outshine all of the things I had thought of as my failures and my points of shame. In particular, I had settled on the decision to enter the civil service, and so I thought covering my bases in mechanical engineering and economics would make me this special individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, I didn’t really know what I liked. I mean, I had this big dream and mission, but I was 18, sheltered for most of my life, barely going beyond the coddling of a classroom (perhaps H3 research counts, but not much more) to have a good sense of what I liked, what I didn’t, and what I was &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; with doing. It gave me comfort to “follow the crowd” - except that my crowd was not my peers, but my role models - plenty of figures of authority in my life had been engineers, and I figured, “hey, why not”, and counted on this misplaced idealism of mine to derive meaning from the work I’d be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not quite meant to be though, and cracks started to show even before I began school. I turned down the seemingly-always-coveted-overly-prestigious PSC Scholarship (the application process in itself is it’s own story), for many reasons, a lot of which was to do with my reservations towards engineering. But the train had already left the station - I had already accepted an offer from NUS to study the double degree, and I figured I’d just go ahead with it. I wish I could say I thought it through and decided it was a risk worth taking, but really, it was me intentionally ignoring what seemed to be warning signs in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My three semesters of engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three semesters were… interesting. Interesting is often the word one uses to describe gifts they don’t like in an effort to be polite, and to put it lightly, I found engineering (at least at NUS) to be a load of horseshit. At least for the first two semesters. Math courses were more about exams than derivations and proofs, labs were overly simplistic, and I hardly learnt anything more than what I’d seen in JC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added to my sense of disillusionment towards engineering. And I started realizing that me not liking engineering really could be a real problem. So I spent a lot of time doing random projects - some more than others related to my courses of study - with the intention of finding something that I would go “this is it, this feels right”. After all, you gotta explore to know what you want. And at that point, all I knew was how to take exams, and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my second semester, interestingly, I had a chat with this friend of mine, Jessica - and she mentioned that she was considering changing her course of study from Chemical Engineering to Environmental Studies. She, too, hated engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my seniors insisted - engineering in year 1 is dumb, year 2 will be cool, and will kick your ass. So I decided to keep my mind open, and try another semester of engineering. Year 2 came along - and I carefully selected my classes. I hadn’t told anyone of my idea of changing course - it might not come to pass, after all, but I knew I needed to begin exploring. So I did 7 modules - some more focused on engineering (fluid mechanics, strength of materials, introduction to material science), some more relevant to my second degree in economics - I wasn’t giving this up (statistical computing, accounting for economists), and the class that would change the trajectory of my life - introduction to machine learning. I also threw myself into a robotics club and begged to work on all systems - mechanical, electronic/control and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dominated the curves that semester as I got straight A+‘s in what has been my best semester academically to date. The robotics project was also going well. But delving deeper, what should have been satisfaction in topping the cohort in my engineering classes was instead a sense of emptiness - the feeling that I could never see myself using this knowledge. Instead, I had deeply and intimately enjoyed my introduction to machine learning class - a class all my peers hated with a passion, going so far as to self learn deep learning from textbooks. I knew at that point I had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing my course - thank you Ms Ng&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, people ask me why I changed my course, and often when they do so there’s this smirk they have thinking I did so because of the annual GES results indicating that CS graduates were well paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t quite that. In fact, it isn’t that at all. I knew I liked machine learning, because god, there’s something so interesting and wonderful how mathematical statistics combined with a bunch of linear algebra can basically spit out magic. But I also had a chip on my shoulder - CS students were (and still are) known to often be a bunch of irritatingly-smart and competitive individuals. I was doing well in engineering, and having no real background in the math I now do today with relative comfort, I was genuinely afraid of being mediocre. Not just my grades, but in just, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I made my peace with it - I figured at some point that I’d rather be mediocre than hate not just my major, but the prospect of finding work I found no meaning in. At least, in my naive mind at the time, I figured at the very worst, I’d be a poorly paid, but not-unhappy software engineer. And that turned out to be a profound bit of growth that has carried through in a lot of the decisions I’ve made to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my secondary school teacher that gave me the push I needed. I hadn’t always been a good student - in fact, I was a very bad one in most of my secondary and high school. I often cut class claiming to be sick and did not complete assignments, and at one point it got so bad in high school that I was out of class more than I was in it. One classmate even once commented “oh, you’re here today” in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. This teacher of mine from secondary school - Ms Ng, is someone who looked past my misbehaviour and often gave me the benefit of the doubt. She was kind and nurturing, and her class was one I always paid attention to, because I owed it to her to at least repay her for her faith in me. She invited me for a bike ride (we road bike) with her husband and another friend of hers. This friend of hers was incidentally a software engineer at Google, unbeknownst to me at the time. On this ride, I talked about my thoughts of changing my course, some of my concerns, and Ms Ng essentially said something along the lines of “do you want to take this risk when you’re young, or when you’re 28 and have children?“. It was enough, and I got home, filled in the application form, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for that, Ms Ng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last two years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, so much has happened, and I’ve grown so much. Changing my course of study was terrifying for a lot of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it anyway though, and it has been one of, if not the best, decision I’ve made for myself. And I can’t help but feel proud about how far I’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first year in CS could only be described as brutual but wonderful. In that year, I studied discrete stuctures, OOP, computer organization, statistics, data structures &amp;#x26; algorithms, database systems. I remember the shellshock I felt after many of the midterms and finals for these courses, in particular the one for discrete structures with my dear friend Aryan. I remember the hours and hours of studying to get good at these topics while the lecturer whizzed by at what felt like an overwhelming pace. I deeply remember literally not understanding pipelining and caching until the night before the final, when things suddenly just clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also remember that in all of these times I struggled, I thought, well, it could be worse - I could be studying mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second year in CS was better - like most things in life, your fundamentals compound, and having pretty solid fundamentals really helped me to learn quickly. I did classes on software engineering, machine learning, advanced algorithms, OS and networks, and boy oh boy did I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t get me started on the CS internship grind - the thousand leetcode practices, hackerrank assessments, and the other thousand hours spent on applying and the sense of exhaustion and little hit to your self esteem that comes when you get an email that starts with “Thank you for your application”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where I’m headed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the last two years have whizzed by, and I’ve grown a ton both from my course work and internship experiences. I’ve done close to a dozen CS courses, interned at DSO, the Institute of Data Science and an insanely-intense-but-wonderfully-nurturing startup in Hypotenuse AI, and these experiences have in equal parts tested me and fortified me as an engineer and general nerd interested in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fortunate enough to be headed to ETH Zurich for the coming semester, an interesting internship at Palantir in London after that, and then another one at Apple after that. It’s going to be an exciting year, and god, I feel so lucky that I can say that I love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I feel scared that I’ll get lost in the seemingly neverending grind that is a career in CS, but I have some faith that I’ll always come back to the thought of “well, it could be worse, I could have been in engineering” to give me some solace and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping for another good year ahead, and if you’ve read this far, if you, too, are thinking of changing your course of study, let’s have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My own evolution of resumes]]></title><description><![CDATA[I think it’s not hard to find plenty of good resources on building your career in tech - Kenneth’s very famous blog post, for example, is…]]></description><link>https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I think it’s not hard to find plenty of good resources on building your career in tech - Kenneth’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/&quot;&gt;very famous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is one of the most popular ones. For a while now, my journey in university and tech has been a bit unconventional, and I’d just like to put it out there - just to provide my nothing-special-about-it perspective and maybe that helps to ground someone else’s experiences. In some ways, &lt;a href=&quot;https://haushofer.ne.su.se/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; is kinda what I’m going for - just some perspective, and maybe it’ll entertain someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR of this blog post is really just me going through the challenges I faced in my job hunt, some things that I think worked, some that I think didn’t. I’ll go through it chronologically, so it’s hopefully something of a helpful basis for comparison for someone in a similar stage of their development. Like Kenneth, I intend to share my resumes, and I think I’ll also link to some helpful resources I found along the way, but the focus is really just documenting a journey in a bite-size way to hopefully help someone contextualize their own experiences. It’s a N=1 sample of one’s journey in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Year 1, 1.5: I changed my major (2019-2020)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was lost because my major did not feel right in Y1 and Y2 - I hated it, and was kinda miserable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent most of my time doing a bunch of projects (e.g. competitions) hoping that one of them would stick and help me figure out what I liked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was really hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the advice of some teachers I bit the bullet and changed my major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey in Computer Science has been unconventional. I entered university studying mechanical engineering, and I really did not enjoy a lot of it. Hated it, really. But I kinda knew that something didn’t feel right even before coming into university, so really, a lot of my first year to year-and-a-half was spent on doing as many things as widely and broadly as possible - case competitions, engineering projects, book clubs, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing, it was really just exploring and praying that “things will work out eventually”. As a result, I never even considered interning in the summer of year 1. Some of my friends did, but I was so far away from knowing what I wanted to do that I didn’t even feel underqualified - I just felt lost. I was stressed all the time about it, and often times felt as if “maybe I can just roll with it”. I never did, though, because it never sat right with me to study something I hated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for those of you who’re not sure about what you’re studying, please, take my advice on this - figure it out, and figure it out early. It is more important than anything else you can do right now, because it gets a lot harder the further and deeper you go. If you’re in year 1 and 2, or about to enter university, spend as much time as you can on opportunities &lt;em&gt;that give you more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do things that are orthorganal to one another, do not repeat - that gives you the most information about what you like in the least time! They are a waste of time, and 2 competition wins do not look significantly nicer than 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a lot of time talking to people about what they’re doing &lt;em&gt;and why they did it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re faced with a big choice (e.g. changing your major), get a young adult’s perspective - they are close enough to our age, but far enough along in life that they can better weigh whether your anxieties are short sighted. A teacher of mine once reminded me that changing your career is 100x harder when you’re 32 than when you’re 22, and that was enough to convince me to change my major.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by some robotics projects and nudging by trusted adults, I changed my major, and started studying CS in Y2S2. Things felt right, finally, but I was about to enter the ever-anxiety-inducing and infamous CS internship grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 2: the internship grind begins (2021)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS wasn’t easy, I felt dumb eternally, I kinda still do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kenneth’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/&quot;&gt;blog post on resumes&lt;/a&gt; got me started on resume writing, do check it out because it’s pretty helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Googling, LinkedIn and glassdoor for e.g. “Machine Learning Engineer” is kinda enough to find things to apply for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I mass-applied for internships despite being desperately unqualified; I didn’t even do leetcode (don’t do this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying only in February (don’t do this either, most interesting things are sadly, gone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I passed 4/28 resume screens, got 2 offers despite failing some interviews spectacularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t waste your time like I did writing cover letters, it literally makes no difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I think the “usual thing” to do is to have an internship in year 2 summer, year 3 summer, and then graduate into a job that you hopefully don’t hate. I was now approaching the summer of year 2, so I had to get started. But boy oh boy was I lost. How do I write a resume? Where do I find jobs? How do I pass an interview? How do I organize my applications? Where do I start? I had these questions, and considering how many blogs write about them, I doubt I’m the only one to have thought these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background at this point was of a robotics engineer and 0 CS background - I had literally just changed my course of study, after all. While applying, I was taking CS2030S (an OOP class), CS1231S (discrete structures) and CS2100 (computer organization) - I barely knew anything about computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I eventually figured doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; even if sub-optimally was better than doing nothing, so I just got started. In my own records, I applied to a grand total of 28 different places, largely finding them through google, linkedIn, glassdoor, for a mix of mechanical engineer, data analytics, UI/UX and ML engineer roles. I also wasted a ton of time writing cover letters, mistakenly believing it made some sort of difference - they don’t, at least, not really. Here’s my resume at the time, for reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I believe only 4 got back to me, and I got 2 offers. One of the failed applications though, I remember really clearly, because they were really kind about me failing what is (now) a very easy programming problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am eternally grateful to have somehow gotten an offer from DSO to do machine learning research on radar imaging systems. I learnt a lot and honestly met some really awesome people, but I don’t for a second think that I got it because I’m good - I was lucky, and I think about that very often because it grounds me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 2 summer: my first internship at DSO and being largely lost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSO wasn’t particularly nurturing, and I was put in a position where I had not much relevant skills nor support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I struggled, made a ton of mistakes, but delivered in the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It sucked, but I’m grateful for being in the position to learn stuff - it could have been worse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, working at DSO wasn’t terrible, but also wasn’t great. For one, I was brought in to do research on machine learning for &lt;em&gt;radar image processing&lt;/em&gt; - I had 0 background in signal processing or the relevant physics. I spent most days self-studying the math behind signal processing, reading a ton of papers on computer vision models and techniques, and banging my head wondering why my simulation pipeline had a bug in it - because it could come from my lack of understanding the physics, the fact that I was using parallel computation for the pipeline (which, again I learnt by literally reading the CUDA handbook), or just a careless mistake. The frustrating bit was that it was often the former two cases, and I sadly did not have as much support or guidance as I would have liked. Building the models were similarly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from a larger perspective, I think working in that kind of low-support environment really is just a trial-by-fire - it sucked and honestly beat a lot at my self confidence. And plus, I made a lot of mistakes. But it also helps to know that I didn’t freeze and sink - I tried my best to learn as fast as I can, and built some working models and a simulation pipeline that to my knowledge is still in use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my internship, I was exhausted - and I recently even found out from someone at DSO who spoke to my then-boss that I’m apparently not good at solving “open problems”. I respectfully disagree, but I’m still grateful for having an internship at all at the time. They took a gamble on me, and I’m not sure either party was satisfied, but I learnt new things and had something to put on my resume, and for that alone I’m happy. Making the best of it, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 3: startup copium (2021-2022)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason people tell you to apply as early as September, and god, that causes so much anxiety, but there’s some truth to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I knew I wasn’t good enough for super competitive positions - and I made peace with it by focusing on high-quality startups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find a helpful set of startups with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stars.sginnovate.com/talentprogrammes&quot;&gt;SGInnovate’s Summation program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can study for ML interviews from useful sources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/&quot;&gt;Chip Huyen’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rish16.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Bites-7c1675ecb587451e9caf793c68972276&quot;&gt;Rishabh’s&lt;/a&gt; blogs, and generally ask for good advice on &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/projectintern&quot;&gt;project intern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing applications &amp;#x26; OAs with school is honestly not easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to do too much, doing research, applying for internships and 6 mods - it was hell - and I wish I didn’t do it that way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I buffed up my resume, did a ton of (but still, not enough) leetcode, and it helped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a website out of insecurity, but I genuinely doubt it makes a difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got 3 offers, and chose the one that would give me the highest learning value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you guys, but everyone told me to apply “early”, as in, in like September the year before kinda early. To me, it was (and still is) crazy talk - why would you apply basically a year ahead?? But everyone did so, and I did, too. In hindsight, you don’t need to get started &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; early or be very stressed about it, but yeah, getting started early helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that I was still insecure, still really shit at programming, and honestly just didn’t want to face another harsh round of rejections. Irrational feelings aside, though, I think it’s fair for me feel like shit - I mean, in September, I was &lt;em&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms, a super basic course in CS - and hadn’t taken other stuff like CS2103 Software Engineering, CS2106 Operating Systems, etc. No matter how you slice it, I’m not particularly qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I made peace with it (low key was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_cannon_brookes_how_you_can_use_impostor_syndrome_to_your_benefit?language=en&quot;&gt;this TED talk about imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;) by just admitting to myself that indeed, I’m not good enough - but I want to be one day, and the best way to start is to learn. So I just aimed to optimize for learning aggressively, and kinda just avoided conversations when people talked about how they got an offer from Stripe or FAANG or HRT or whatever. I was on my own journey, and that was going to be it. Applying for a ton of startups, research, a ton of leetcode, and studying hard, I had decided, were going to be how I was going to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of (but honestly still not enough) leetcode - I’d practice maybe once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked around in &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/projectintern&quot;&gt;project intern&lt;/a&gt; for advice, resources and stuff to prepare for interviews, and generally got good stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/&quot;&gt;Chip Huyen’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rish16.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Bites-7c1675ecb587451e9caf793c68972276&quot;&gt;Rishabh’s&lt;/a&gt; excellent resources on ML interviews. Being part of that group in itself can be stressful though, so you kinda gotta manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for a ton of startups. I was, however, very selective about them - I had heard all sorts of horror stories about them, so I was determined to pick one with strong founders (at least on paper) and that had green flags going for it (e.g. YC backed). I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://stars.sginnovate.com/talentprogrammes&quot;&gt;SGInnovate’s Summation Program&lt;/a&gt; to be really helpful, and that ended up being how I got my offer and one of the best summer’s I’ve had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took 6 mods at school. Why? I… don’t know. I just wanted to study as fast as I could. It was really hard and often times very emotionally challenging to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also fortunate to get an opportunity to work with Dr. Wynne Hsu on some research for fake news reasoning and detection (more on this later, because entering research is a whole other space of imposter syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also buffed up my resume at the advice of some friends. Specifically, I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added links to my socials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added a quick summary. I doubt it would work, but also figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added colour for quicker readability/highlight what I thought might be important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added more concrete descriptors (e.g. improve performance by 700x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After asking some seniors who did hiring, added a small section on the tech stacks I’d worked with (or figured I could learn fast enough for an interview).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed my JC from my education, since I didn’t need the “filler” anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a project that was my website as a showcase that I could do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; frontend dev. I’m still shit at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it looked:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a website out of some mistaken feeling that it would make me more appealing to recruiters. I doubt it did. But it was fun, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this application cycle, I made about 68 applications according to my records - but it’s probably more, seeing as I stopped logging them after a while. I iterated through 2 resume versions. I got a total of 3 offers - World Quant, Hypotenuse AI and Affable AI, and took the one at Hypotenuse AI. Their interviews were &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt; the hardest - it was 3 hours of non-stop grilling. Convinced me that they knew what they were doing and there was high learning value in joining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the semester and application cycle (and therefore, my struggles) came to an end, I had some reflections that I think are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being very selective about startups was a good idea&lt;/strong&gt;
I applied to quite a few - in the Summation Programme alone, I applied to AI Pallete, Affable AI, Polybee, Lauretta.io, Finantier and Hypotenuse AI. In many of these, and most of the startup interviews, I felt that they lacked rigour - questions were mostly non-technical in nature. The only ones that were different were Affable AI and Hypotenuse AI - they had challenging take home assignments and interesting technical and system design questions, and generally gave me the sense that they were talented people who knew what they were doing. This is important to me - and I think in general - because the opportunity cost of interning at a startup is not only the pay cut, but the learning opportunity from talented engineers/mentorship. In fast-moving organizations, interning without mentorship sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t need to apply that early for startups&lt;/strong&gt;
I applied for startups in September. All of them asked why when I said it was for summer. A good number of them asked me to reapply in February, lol. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t half-ass many things, whole-ass one thing&lt;/strong&gt;
I struggled so, so hard this semester. 6 mods, research, job applications… not conducive to mental health, personal relationships or your physical health. You also don’t do things as well as you can, because you’re stretched so thin. In fact, failing to really push on my research is one of the greatest regrets I have till this day. I’m not sure I could have done more, and there’s always the “what if”, but god, I wish I slowed down a little and didn’t spread myself so thin. You live and you learn, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you can talk about everything on your resume&lt;/strong&gt;
This means literally making sure the links aren’t broken, but also that you have enough familiarity to explain design choices, tech stacks, whatever. I really struggled in one of my interviews because I really struggled to put across why my project was hard and why my design choices made sense (the interviewer was very patient though, and thankfully so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leetcode once a week is not enough (for me)&lt;/strong&gt;
I did medium/hards once a week. Did not see much improvement, and often struggled at mediums. To be fair, was also doing CS2040S during the application cycle, so it’s kinda hard to do leetcode without knowing the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also rewarded myself with a trip to Bali at the end of this gruelling semester. I’m glad I did, because I felt refreshed and recharged and it made a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 3 summer: long hours but lots of learning at Hypotenuse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentorship was excellent, I was given a ton of responsibilities, and I always felt valued and cared for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learnt so, so much, and built so many things - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hypotenuse.ai/features/content-detective&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hypotenuse.ai/ai-image-generator&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was offered a full-time role, but very sadly turned it down to go on exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably the happiest 3 months I had in a long while, and I think I’d like to go back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working hours were rough and I often felt out of my depth (so many things built from scratch), though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality startups really are great places for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Hypotenuse, my role was a mish-mash of full-stack and machine learning engineering responsibilities. I suppose as with most startups, I did a ton of stuff. But I think I was impressed by how well they had gotten the balance of structure and flexibility down - onboarding was excellent as were task allocations, I always felt valued and protected as an engineer with frequent one-on-one chats, I never felt like I couldn’t ask questions or that I couldn’t pitch difficult but workable solutions - it was all round just such a great and nurturing place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, the hours were long - I averaged 9-10 most days, and we often joked that we saw each other more than our families. But it never once felt begrudging. I always felt like I was moving - I was learning a lot and very quickly, and it always felt like the team was moving. Pushing out new features, seeing our growth stats, pushing x, y and everything. It was addictive, and somehow it felt like I really thrived in that kind of dynamic and low-key chaotic environment. The people made it great too, because my fellow interns were funny and super-solid people, and the full-timers too. We still all keep in touch, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean it was all flowers and rainbows, though - deadlines could be stressful, I often felt stuck and out of my depth (everything you build is basically built from scratch or working with code that was written quickly), and on occasion I would see my friends at FAANG or Indeed having a company-sponsored lunch with their standing desks and cushy in-town office wondering if that would have been nicer - comparison is the thief of joy, right? But these feelings were often fleeting and relatively insignificant in the bigger picture of what working here meant to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say, joining Hypotenuse has been one of the most fortunate decisions I’ve made, and if you, too, are considering joining a startup, maybe take a leap of faith if all the requisite green flags are there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founders with good track record (e.g. at Hypotenuse, they all had relevant experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product you genuinely think has value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interview process is smooth and you get the sense they know what they’re doing during it (remember, you’re interviewing them, too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hard, but it might just be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 4: surprising successes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I applied a lot more bravely this time - everywhere, and anywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a lot more leetcode and in a structured way, really thinking about how to solve things rather than doing it blindly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also studied SWE stuff, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It sucked because I did this and applications alongside the infamous CS3203 Software Engineering Project and 2 TA roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got some early rejections that really deflated me (e.g. Stripe, GovTech)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized I really don’t like quant roles (e.g. at GS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hiring cycle felt hard because many firms didn’t (e.g. Indeed) and a lot of them got back to me months later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came off the summer on some sort of a high - I felt like I’d grown a lot as an engineer, and felt ready to make a bigger step to Big Tech or working abroad. Even if I wasn’t going to be there long term, I wanted to experience it. I had to make a tough choice to turn down a full-time offer at Hypotenuse, but I did, and back to school and the application grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still stressed and insecure, but in a way that was different from the previous cycle. This time, I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a lot more leetcode - we’re looking at 2-3 medium/hards a day. I found things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://neetcode.io/&quot;&gt;NeetCode&lt;/a&gt; and logging my own progress/tips and tricks on a Notion page really helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applied widely and really dared to think bigger this time - FAANG (well, those that were open for applications), quant shops and US-based startups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found that SWE roles require a different set of prep compared to ML roles, and studied for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also buffed up my resume a bit&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I was quite happy with this application cycle. I applied to a total of 112 companies according to my Notion. The sheer number of interviews I did helped to keep me warm, as did the leetcode, but it also really told me about the types of companies I really didn’t like. Just as much as an interview is about them evaluating you, you are also evaluating them. Moving forward, I’m pretty sure finance firms/banks ain’t it for me. I really didn’t like GS’s or JPM’s (and a few others) hiring styles. But startups and big tech are still pretty cool, except for some (ahem ByteDance). Also, something I noticed was that for some reason somehow this year’s replies/rejections/advancement to next round seemed super slow. As I write this in January, I’ve gotten about 5 emails telling me I’ve passed the resume screen - despite applying in October or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of rejections this year, and for many parts in this cycle I was pretty demoralized. I stopped counting when the rejections hit 40 or so, lol. The good ‘ol “Thank you for your application” in the email subject stirs something in me to this day. I think I found being rejected by Stripe and GovTech to be particularly disappointing, and they really shook my confidence in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to receive a total of 5 offers - Apple, Palantir, Worldquant, Munich Re, AMD. I’ve accepted Palantir and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratefulness aside, reflecting on the things I did, I think here are some thoughts I think are worth sharing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not that good at algo questions, but god, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;leetcode&lt;/code&gt; really helps. Who knew?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flunked the Google OA and Bytedance’s one I found really hard. Apart from that, regular leetcode was really helpful. Beyond that though, I started to find myself enjoying doing them daily/every other day. It was like a fun getaway where I could plug in my headphones and just do some dumb coding. Was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast the net wide, it’s a numbers game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my past few years, I notice that the rates of passing the resume screen and offer rates are roughly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020: 2/28 offers (7.2%), 34/28 (14.3%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2021: 3/68 offers (4.4%), 7/68 (10.3%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2022: 5/112 offers (4.5%), 15/112 (13.9%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this year is skewed since we’re only in January and I’m stopping the count, but still, looking at these numbers and their stable proportions, I can’t help but wonder if it truly is a numbers game. We’re also in a strange time of hiring freezes this and last year, so perhaps that’s also affected what I would have expected to be generally growing proportions of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I guess, this makes me feel better about all those rejections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still don’t know what I’m doing, and I’m just trying to focus on being a better engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve come a long way since the start, and I think I have a clearer sense of what I want to do with my life after graduation (inside and outside of work), but I wouldn’t say I know it with conviction. I just have a sense of it. I kinda doubt I’ll ever not have doubts in my choices or feel supremely confident about everything - I don’t think I’d want to either, because I’d probably be an insufferable asshole - so I think I’ll go back to what I’ve been focusing on: learning and being a better engineer. It gives me a sense of groundedness and contentment - I mean, maybe I’ll be a shit engineer, and maybe I won’t go far, but I can tell myself I tried my best, and I think that’s good enough. I think I’m in part inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/&quot;&gt;this wonderful blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/long-term&quot;&gt;this other one&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d do no justice explaining it here - but the general idea is that I am optimizing for learning &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; because it just makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man, comparison really is the thief of joy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I think occasionally comes up and I’d like to share my views on - is the stress of comparison. It’s inevitable - I’m working my ass off doing leetcode, applying for 102847184 positions and doing their online assessments, and failing, but my friends (seemingly) easily get an offer from FAANG or Stripe or Indeed despite applying late. I know those are exaggerations, but it really got to me at times. I have no solution or panacea, other than to say “it be like that”, and to have faith in yourself, grit your teeth, and find some solace in the fact that you’re trying your best. The good ‘ol “trust the process” and “try to be content”, I guess. What I’m really trying to say is, it really just is what it is, and there’s nothing you can do about how you feel about comparisons, so be kinder to yourself, and let the comparisons tell you what’s out there, what’s next, rather than “what you’ve failed to achieve”. It’s helped me cope, so maybe it’ll help you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I achieved what I set out to do - provide an N=1 sample of how it feels like to go through the tech application cycle (and also, I guess, grow up?). I hoped you at least found it entertaining. Well, if nothing at all, it was like therapy for me, so that’s good, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for everyone who’s helped me along the way, and I’d like to say for anyone of you guys out there - keep going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll look back on this one day with a palm on my face and in embarrassment. Anyway, for now, I’m headed to Zurich for exchange, and after that I’ll fortunately be interning at Palantir in London. Exciting times! Imposter syndrome is sure to get me, but hey, let’s hope I float.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello world!]]></title><description><![CDATA[A new website About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself.

&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself. Why? Honestly, I’m not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about “not being competitive” in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Including blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that’s a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I’ve also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I’m willing to put &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I’ve read a lot of others’ blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I’m not alone going through some of the experiences we share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it’s not just noise. I do think it’ll be like therapy for me, though, lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
