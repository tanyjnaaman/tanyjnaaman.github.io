&lt;p&gt;In the last month, I’ve spent so much time trying to meet and spend time with people I care about. Friends, family, extended family. I’ve typically been incredibly introverted, so this has been quite an… interesting and refreshing experience. In fact, in the last three weeks, my daily routine has basically been lunch with someone, run some errands, dinner with someone, sleep, repeat. This month has also coincided with the Lunar New Year, so I’ve also visited family and gone to Malaysia to visit my family there. It’s been so busy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s been so good! So many of these friends I’ve not seen in a while - we’re all busy, and myself, every since university has started, I can’t say I’ve really had any lull periods other than this month. So it’s been nice to spend time and catch up with many of these friends who I care for very deeply, and spend some time on myself recharging and reflecting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am now, on the cusp on another great adventure. I’m kinda nervous, kinda excited. It’s 12.53pm as I write this, and I’m more or less packed, set to have dinner with two close friends and then off I am on a flight to Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably feels like a bigger deal than it is because many of my friends are graduating before I am (they study 4 years, I study 5) and are going abroad for grad school - so for many of them I won’t see for maybe a year and a half or so, maybe more. I’m happy and excited for all of these people - they are talented, intelligent and down-to-earth people who will do great things; I’ll just miss them, is all. And I think I’ll look back on and occasionally miss the simpler times. After all, in year 1 and 2 of university, everyone stayed on campus, hung out regularly, and the greatest worry we had were our grades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m back, a lot of things will be different, I think. I’d have completed a semester at ETH, worked at Palantir, most of my friends would be abroad and/or graduated, and I imagine I, too, would have seen some change and growth. I’m equally scared and excited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 more hours till I’m on that plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First three days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Zurich is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it here. People are nice, public transport is great, I generally feel safe. The city centre is beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 24 hours have been focused on &lt;strong&gt;buying stuff&lt;/strong&gt;, because god, my room was really barebones, and there’s so much minute overhead to just living, lol. Been to Ikea and carried a bunch of stuff back, been to a couple supermarkets and done the same, and I’m almost done. Just left with some small quality-of-life purchases like a drying rack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1: landed, got a SIM card, rail pass, checked in, bought some groceries, went to ikea, made some friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2: went to the city centre with some friends, spent a ton of time walking around, had sandwich, some famous hot chocolate, saw a cool church and some great views of the river, hit a big supermarket, and cooked my first meal. Made more friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 3: chatted with new people over breakfast. Went to the city centre for a tour. Made friends with people on said tour, and spent basically the whole day with them. Went back, made dinner (very bad yakisoba attempt, it’s so hard without the right ingredients ._.), had some nice conversations and made more new friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired, but so far, so good. I hope I’ll continue to make friends and do cool things. Tomorrow, is my first German class. Fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The 14th day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I have been on Swiss soil for 14 days now. Life is going pretty well - I’ve settled in quite nicely I think. It’s gone by &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt; though. In the last week or so I’ve completed German 1 (it’s 3 x 2 hours a day, every day) which fulfils the first half of A1 German, climbed my first hill (the Swiss call it a molehill, but to my Singaporean mind the hike was tall), cooked my first rack of lamb for valentine’s day (my girlfriend was kind enough to visit me from London), watched my first movie abroad (Swiss tickets are 17 CHF, and they have intermissions!) and got very cold a lot of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been very good, but very exhausting. Moving abroad and setting up a comfortable (if temporary) “home”, doing 6 hours of high-intensity language learning daily and packing my schedule to spend time with my girlfriend while she’s visiting is pretty tough. Switzerland is beautiful though, and people here are generally very welcoming. And thank god for the fact that most people speak English - I’d have such a tough time otherwise.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today in particular, my girlfriend has headed back to London, and I’m alone here. In the coming week, it’s a bunch of admin and welcome events, the start of lessons and presumably a bunch of socializing and a return to using my brain after a month-long break. I’m really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year feels like it’s shaping up to be a pretty good year, and I have a lot of things to look forward to. Fingers crossed next week is a good week, too. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Readings I come  back to]]></title><description><![CDATA[Blogs I check out Yi Tay Shreya Shankar Rishahb Anand David Mueller Nato Lambert Stuff in general Startups will ruin your life in the best…]]></description><link>https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/some-blog-posts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/some-blog-posts/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Blogs I check out&lt;/h2&gt;

For those unfamiliar with those courses - CS2040 is a data structures and algorithms course for non-computing students, and CS3244 is a class on machine learning. The former is notorious for being challenging for non-computing students, while the latter has a reputation for being a little too touch-and-go in terms of how it teaches content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like classes on algorithms - I think they teach me very clever and often elegant ways of solving new problems I have often never seen, and in particular I think they simply expand the way I see things. I’m not very good at algorithms though - neither CS2040S nor later, CS3230 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms, a more advanced algorithms class) came easy to me. But I had the fortune of experiencing the teaching of some pretty good TAs, and wanted to pay it forward. This blog post in particular is inspired by one of those TAs - Christopher, the then head TA for CS3230. He was not my TA, but my TA was bad, and his sessions were recorded, and his classes helped me to get through the module. He wrote about his experience teaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisjwelly.github.io/blog/2022/01/05/Career-Progression-CS3230-TA/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it’s worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like machine learning. I mean, I used to study mechanical engineering, and it was my exposure to machine learning that convinced to change my course and throw myself into it. I think it’s kinda incredible how some clever linear algebra and statistics can basically spit out magic. I’ve actually never taken CS3244 - in fact, my journey in machine learning has been a little unconventional, as most of it is self-learnt. It began with EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning. But it was on-the-job at DSO as a machine learning engineer where I learnt about deep learning models and how to build them. And then on-the-job at the Institute of Data Science with a not-very-successful research project with Dr. Wynne Hsu where I learnt about NLP and graph machine learning, in part by completing Stanford online’s free CS224N and CS224W courses on NLP and graph machine learning. Then I would take CS4243 Computer Vision at NUS to, as I put it, “get some formal training”. And then it would be back to on-the-job learning at Hypotenuse AI, where I threw myself into large language models, vision-language and generative models in three very intensive months of work. I consider myself to have a slightly-above-average amount of experience in machine learning, but having never taken the class, I was still slightly surprised when I was accepted to be a TA for CS3244. Granted though, I wouldn’t be teaching a class, but instead helping out with the projects, grading and question-setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was being a TA for two courses a good idea alongside a course load of 4 modules, one of which is the notorious CS3203 Software Engineering Project? In hindsight, yes and no - yes because I’ve always wanted to TA, and Y4S1 was as close as it would ever get to me having the bandwith to TA. But also no, because it was honestly not easy to juggle everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to be a good TA is harder than I thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best TA’s I’ve gotten have really focused on building intuition, motivating seemingly-arbitrary things and pointing out common mistakes and pitfalls. I too, wanted to do that in my teaching. Before every class, I’d try prepare a recap of the week’s topics and pick up on areas I thought the lecture didn’t do well. I’d also run through and try to solve the tutorial questions on my own - so imagine my sense of shame when it’d take me longer than I’d like to admit to solve them, or when I’d get lazy and just look at the answer key. Imagine my initial sense of surprise and later dread towards these prep sessions too, when I realized that preparing for each class would take me around 1-2 hours in a very busy semester. My teaching style, especially at the start, was also very whiteboard-y, as in, I used an ipad to draw stuff out. Some students liked that, some didn’t, and I slowly found my equilibrium between the two only in the later parts of the semester. Sorry kids, I wish I was better at this. You can see my slides &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I would find out, preparing for class and then delivering it are also very different things. In fact, a consistent pattern I noticed in the two consecutive 9-10am and 10-11am classes I taught were that the 10-11am class would get far better version of my class. The early-risers were punished for being my guinea pigs. Despite “rehearsing” the night before, I would often stumble in the first class when a question I didn’t expect or had thought through prior to class came up, or when I realized my explanation wasn’t quite hitting the mark, or when I realized &lt;em&gt;halfway through the class&lt;/em&gt; that my explanation was not quite correct. I’m not great at improvising on the spot, but I tried my best to be honest with my class when I made a mistake or when I wasn’t quite teaching the content as well as I’d hoped, and they were generally very understanding about it. The second class almost had no such experience. Interestingly though, in the test statistics, my earlier class generally did better. Fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as the semester went on, I got better at preparing for class and anticipating questions, and as with most things, presenting content to a class gets better with practice, and classes were generally smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being a project mentor is also kinda hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CS2040, I was a tutorial teacher. For CS3244, I was a project mentor (amidst some other administrative responsibilities) - and that entailed meeting with project groups, giving them technical advice and grading their work (without them knowing). I had expected it to mean they would come prepared with questions, give me consistent updates, and I’d simply tell them this or that and it’d be a relatively easy $40 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think students kinda exist on a spectrum, and it’s no different for CS3244. I got some excellent, self-motivated, well-organized students who surpassed my expectations, and equally I also got some who… shall we say, needed more hand-holding and drama-management. It was interesting to see, and to see it as someone who had the authority to arbitrate conflicts, award exceptional work, or appropriately credit mediocre ones. It felt strange, sometimes cruel even, but I tried my best, and I hope my students never felt like I was leaving them out to dry or too harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting questions is really fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing out of CS3244 was me being able to set finals questions. It was so fun. This one did not make it to the final, so I can share it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I don’t like admin and students harrass you, lol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three more-memorable pieces of advice I got from some of my friends with TA experience when I told them I was about to TA for these classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give students your telegram handle/phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the TA you wish you had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students create more drama than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three turned out to be pretty good pieces of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 1: I got so, so many messages. I still tried my best to answer them, but I joke with some of my friends that maybe that’s why some courses use Microsoft Teams as a channel for questions - no one uses Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2: I got a lot more satisfaction, and I think my students generally appreciated it. It also shows in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMUM9bcACHBIcd0fDim4fqCXZtHJUVfA/view?usp=share_link&quot;&gt;teaching feedback&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m pretty happy about.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 3: Yea… You just gotta manage it fairly and consistently, I guess. I tried my best not to be too harsh, but sometimes I had to put my foot down. I’m a bit of a softie, and this was tricky for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, admin things like grading and invigilation really suck, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Would I TA again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could, I would. In part because after reading my feedback, I’d like to do better - for example, I got interesting feedback - female students tended to enjoy or benefit from my classes less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think for the remaining part of my educational journey at NUS, it’s going to be tricky to. So I probably won’t. Maybe if I ever go to grad school, I just might.

&lt;p&gt;Just about two years ago, it was the January of 2021. I got an email from the School of Computing, indicating that my
application to transfer my course of study to Computer Science had been successful. I distinctly recall the moment -
I was at the robotics lab with my team, working on the gimbal mechanism for the Standard Robot. It had been a pretty good day actually - development was going well and we had a good amount of momentum going. I also recall that it was the third round of ModReg - for the uninitiated, ModReg is the module registration system at NUS, and having 0 modules registered in the third round usually spells death - and it was the exact situation I was in, given that I had now been newly promoted to a Computer Science major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as I would learn is a very common thing in the School of Computing, I reached out to what might as well be the fairy godmother of all of us - Ms Toh Mui Kiat, and she sorted me out with some of the most important fundamental classes in CS - OOP, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization, Probability and Statistics - all classes I would come to love (and hate at times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That semester would begin what has been the very wild, often times wonderful, but equally frequently emotionally, mentally and physically challenging journey that I have been on for the last two years. But it’s been a good two years, and I figured I want to reflect on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I joined mechanical engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to go further back than two years ago for this. Back in 2019, I matriculated as a double degree student in mechanical engineering and economics. Why mechanical engineering? Well, it was sorta related to why economics as well. In much of my teens, I - and I suspect a good number of my peers at the time, too - was very idealistic and going through my own struggles with my health and in school. And this idealism manifested itself as a deep desire to do something somehow so great that it would outshine all of the things I had thought of as my failures and my points of shame. In particular, I had settled on the decision to enter the civil service, and so I thought covering my bases in mechanical engineering and economics would make me this special individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, I didn’t really know what I liked. I mean, I had this big dream and mission, but I was 18, sheltered for most of my life, barely going beyond the coddling of a classroom (perhaps H3 research counts, but not much more) to have a good sense of what I liked, what I didn’t, and what I was &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; with doing. It gave me comfort to “follow the crowd” - except that my crowd was not my peers, but my role models - plenty of figures of authority in my life had been engineers, and I figured, “hey, why not”, and counted on this misplaced idealism of mine to derive meaning from the work I’d be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not quite meant to be though, and cracks started to show even before I began school. I turned down the seemingly-always-coveted-overly-prestigious PSC Scholarship (the application process in itself is it’s own story), for many reasons, a lot of which was to do with my reservations towards engineering. But the train had already left the station - I had already accepted an offer from NUS to study the double degree, and I figured I’d just go ahead with it. I wish I could say I thought it through and decided it was a risk worth taking, but really, it was me intentionally ignoring what seemed to be warning signs in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My three semesters of engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three semesters were… interesting. Interesting is often the word one uses to describe gifts they don’t like in an effort to be polite, and to put it lightly, I found engineering (at least at NUS) to be a load of horseshit. At least for the first two semesters. Math courses were more about exams than derivations and proofs, labs were overly simplistic, and I hardly learnt anything more than what I’d seen in JC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added to my sense of disillusionment towards engineering. And I started realizing that me not liking engineering really could be a real problem. So I spent a lot of time doing random projects - some more than others related to my courses of study - with the intention of finding something that I would go “this is it, this feels right”. After all, you gotta explore to know what you want. And at that point, all I knew was how to take exams, and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my second semester, interestingly, I had a chat with this friend of mine, Jessica - and she mentioned that she was considering changing her course of study from Chemical Engineering to Environmental Studies. She, too, hated engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my seniors insisted - engineering in year 1 is dumb, year 2 will be cool, and will kick your ass. So I decided to keep my mind open, and try another semester of engineering. Year 2 came along - and I carefully selected my classes. I hadn’t told anyone of my idea of changing course - it might not come to pass, after all, but I knew I needed to begin exploring. So I did 7 modules - some more focused on engineering (fluid mechanics, strength of materials, introduction to material science), some more relevant to my second degree in economics - I wasn’t giving this up (statistical computing, accounting for economists), and the class that would change the trajectory of my life - introduction to machine learning. I also threw myself into a robotics club and begged to work on all systems - mechanical, electronic/control and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dominated the curves that semester as I got straight A+‘s in what has been my best semester academically to date. The robotics project was also going well. But delving deeper, what should have been satisfaction in topping the cohort in my engineering classes was instead a sense of emptiness - the feeling that I could never see myself using this knowledge. Instead, I had deeply and intimately enjoyed my introduction to machine learning class - a class all my peers hated with a passion, going so far as to self learn deep learning from textbooks. I knew at that point I had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing my course - thank you Ms Ng&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, people ask me why I changed my course, and often when they do so there’s this smirk they have thinking I did so because of the annual GES results indicating that CS graduates were well paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t quite that. In fact, it isn’t that at all. I knew I liked machine learning, because god, there’s something so interesting and wonderful how mathematical statistics combined with a bunch of linear algebra can basically spit out magic. But I also had a chip on my shoulder - CS students were (and still are) known to often be a bunch of irritatingly-smart and competitive individuals. I was doing well in engineering, and having no real background in the math I now do today with relative comfort, I was genuinely afraid of being mediocre. Not just my grades, but in just, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I made my peace with it - I figured at some point that I’d rather be mediocre than hate not just my major, but the prospect of finding work I found no meaning in. At least, in my naive mind at the time, I figured at the very worst, I’d be a poorly paid, but not-unhappy software engineer. And that turned out to be a profound bit of growth that has carried through in a lot of the decisions I’ve made to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my secondary school teacher that gave me the push I needed. I hadn’t always been a good student - in fact, I was a very bad one in most of my secondary and high school. I often cut class claiming to be sick and did not complete assignments, and at one point it got so bad in high school that I was out of class more than I was in it. One classmate even once commented “oh, you’re here today” in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. This teacher of mine from secondary school - Ms Ng, is someone who looked past my misbehaviour and often gave me the benefit of the doubt. She was kind and nurturing, and her class was one I always paid attention to, because I owed it to her to at least repay her for her faith in me. She invited me for a bike ride (we road bike) with her husband and another friend of hers. This friend of hers was incidentally a software engineer at Google, unbeknownst to me at the time. On this ride, I talked about my thoughts of changing my course, some of my concerns, and Ms Ng essentially said something along the lines of “do you want to take this risk when you’re young, or when you’re 28 and have children?“. It was enough, and I got home, filled in the application form, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for that, Ms Ng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The last two years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, so much has happened, and I’ve grown so much. Changing my course of study was terrifying for a lot of reasons, so let me reformat/rephrase my pros-and-cons list from my phone, dated November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; I like computer science. Well, I liked my machine learning course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate mechanical engineering. It’s cool sometimes, but I’m not a hands-on-tools kinda guy. It exhausts me, because I was exhausted building my robot, but loved every bit of writing code for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might be mediocre. I probably will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already feel like a black sheep in my family, and studying a science (when everyone else has studied business/accounting) will just add to that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might have to graduate late, and NUS might rescind my scholarship (at least, in the contract, they “reserve the right to”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might not be able to continue my second degree in economics. (I later managed to apply for this and got it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All my modules I’ve already completed “go to waste”. I start again from ground 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t know. It just feels scary to be off the conventional path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it anyway though, and it has been one of, if not the best, decision I’ve made for myself. And I can’t help but feel proud about how far I’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first year in CS could only be described as brutual but wonderful. In that year, I studied discrete stuctures, OOP, computer organization, statistics, data structures &amp;#x26; algorithms, database systems. I remember the shellshock I felt after many of the midterms and finals for these courses, in particular the one for discrete structures with my dear friend Aryan. I remember the hours and hours of studying to get good at these topics while the lecturer whizzed by at what felt like an overwhelming pace. I deeply remember literally not understanding pipelining and caching until the night before the final, when things suddenly just clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also remember that in all of these times I struggled, I thought, well, it could be worse - I could be studying mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second year in CS was better - like most things in life, your fundamentals compound, and having pretty solid fundamentals really helped me to learn quickly. I did classes on software engineering, machine learning, advanced algorithms, OS and networks, and boy oh boy did I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t get me started on the CS internship grind - the thousand leetcode practices, hackerrank assessments, and the other thousand hours spent on applying and the sense of exhaustion and little hit to your self esteem that comes when you get an email that starts with “Thank you for your application”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where I’m headed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the last two years have whizzed by, and I’ve grown a ton both from my course work and internship experiences. I’ve done close to a dozen CS courses, interned at DSO, the Institute of Data Science and an insanely-intense-but-wonderfully-nurturing startup in Hypotenuse AI, and these experiences have in equal parts tested me and fortified me as an engineer and general nerd interested in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fortunate enough to be headed to ETH Zurich for the coming semester, an interesting internship at Palantir in London after that, and then another one at Apple after that. It’s going to be an exciting year, and god, I feel so lucky that I can say that I love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I feel scared that I’ll get lost in the seemingly neverending grind that is a career in CS, but I have some faith that I’ll always come back to the thought of “well, it could be worse, I could have been in engineering” to give me some solace and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping for another good year ahead, and if you’ve read this far, if you, too, are thinking of changing your course of study, let’s have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My evolution of applications (and resumes)]]></title><description><![CDATA[I came into Computer Science in the middle of year 2 - I had changed my course from mechanical engineering, mostly because I realized I…]]></description><link>https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tanyjnaaman.github.io/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I came into Computer Science in the middle of year 2 - I had changed my course from mechanical engineering, mostly because I realized I really liked machine learning. But finding jobs haven’t been easy, and I figured I’d share some of the wonderful resources I’ve compiled and little lessons I, too, have learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Kenneth’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/&quot;&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; I learnt how to write my first few resumes, but at the risk of creating slightly duplicated content, I think I want to focus more on the general application process, including my resumes, because I get the sense that resumes are but one part of what is often a very long application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context: my CS journey started in Y2S2, after changing my course of study. My first internship was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; lucky, as I got it through sheer luck via TalentConnect - I interned as an ML engineer at DSO. My second was at a startup called Hypotenuse AI. My third and fourth, both offered at the same time, were at Palantir and Apple respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 2, Semester 2 (2021)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own records, I applied to a grand total of 28 different places, with a mix of mechanical engineer, data analytics, UI/UX and ML engineer roles. My background at this point was of a robotics engineer and 0 CS background - I had literally just changed my course of study and not taken a single course. I got 2 offers - a startup called Cognicept, and DSO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I tried to do with my resume:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the general advice and resources compiled in Kenneth’s blog post, linked above. Read that first!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular: focus on formatting for easy reading + automated resume screening, generally remove irrelevant work I did.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My general application strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had no real strategy - it was my first time applying, and at this point I had spent most of my time studying and/or doing random competitions and projects. I was also quite a recluse, and had no idea about the existence of resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/projectintern&quot;&gt;Project Intern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went on LinkedIn and google, searched for ML engineer intern (most of my experience was in robotics engineering, 0 software) and just applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General mistakes I made:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote a unique resume and cover letter for every application. Cover letters don’t matter, and there “tailoring” a resume by and large wastes time without much benefit. They take &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too long for virtually zero benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying only in February. Everything interesting was gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did 0 leetcode. To be fair, I was basically an engineering student and had no idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 3, Semester 1 &amp;#x26; 2 (2021-2022)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now gone from 0-1, I felt a little better. I was fortunate that my internship at DSO allowed me to learn quite a lot about machine learning workflows and research. But this time, my aim for this application cycle was on startups. The main reason was the belief that a (good) startup would grow me more as a budding engineer. In this application cycle, I made about 68 applications according to my records - but it’s probably more, seeing as I stopped logging them after a while. I iterated through 2 resume versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a total of 3 offers - World Quant, Hypotenuse AI and Affable AI, and took the one at Hypotenuse AI. Their interviews were &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt; the hardest - it was 3 hours of non-stop grilling. Convinced me that they knew what they were doing and there was high learning value in joining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I tried to do with my resume:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a website/linkedin and added links to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added a quick summary. I doubt it would work, but also figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added colour for quicker readability/highlight what I thought might be important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added more concrete descriptors (e.g. improve performance by 700x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After asking some seniors who did hiring, added a small section on the tech stacks I’d worked with (or figured I could learn fast enough for an interview).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed my JC from my education, since I didn’t need the “filler” anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a project that was my website as a showcase that I could do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; frontend dev. I’m still shit at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My general application strategy&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I aimed for startups as I had a chip on my shoulder and feared rejection, which was likely from bigger companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was, however, very &lt;em&gt;selective&lt;/em&gt; about my startups - they had to have founders/engineers of exceptional ability/track record (e.g. top school, advanced degrees, publications, big tech) and backing by known VCs (e.g. YC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found a good programme called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sginnovate.com/apprenticeship/talent&quot;&gt;Summation&lt;/a&gt;, which is backed by the SG government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback I got from friends/interviews and mistakes I made:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume looked a bit haphazard. Colour was nice, but could be hard to read. Uneven spacing/line lengths made it hard to read. Too much content in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did not do enough leetcode still, was struggling with hackerranks at medium. Honestly spent too much time chilling/studying for mods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did not apply widely enough. Focused almost entirely on “high success” applications as I was afraid of rejection (e.g. did not apply for FAANG, Indeed &amp;#x26; similar tech firms, or banks/finance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online courses don’t matter for CS kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure links in resume aren’t broken - one of my interviewers tried to see my stuff, but couldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you can be &lt;em&gt;grilled&lt;/em&gt; for everything you have on the resume. One of my interviews did a &lt;em&gt;deep, deep&lt;/em&gt; dive, and I couldn’t explain some of the work I did/some of the tech stacks (but generally did ok!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some general learning points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being very selective about startups was a good idea&lt;/strong&gt;. I applied to quite a few - AI Pallete, Affable AI, Polybee, Lauretta.io, Finantier and Hypotenuse AI were the 5 in the Summation Programme. In these, and most of the startup interviews, I felt that they lacked rigour - questions were mostly non-technical in nature. The only ones that were different were Affable AI and Hypotenuse AI - they had challenging take home assignments and interesting technical and system design questions, and generally gave me the sense that they were talented people who knew what they were doing. This is important to me - and I think in general - because the opportunity cost of interning at a startup is not only the pay cut, but the learning opportunity from talented engineers/mentorship. In fast-moving organizations, interning without mentorship sucks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally got past resume screen for ML/DS related roles.&lt;/strong&gt; At those points, generally did well because algos would only be one part of it. A big part of ML/DS interviews are theory heavy, and those require a different type of preparation. Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/&quot;&gt;Chip Huyen’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rish16.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Bites-7c1675ecb587451e9caf793c68972276&quot;&gt;Rishabh’s&lt;/a&gt; excellent resources for those. In contrast, barely got past resume screen for any SWE roles. Which made sense, given I had basically zero SWE dev experience and I think the barrier to entry for SWE roles are much lower, making competition much stiffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year 4, Semester 1 (2022-2023)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I was quite happy with this application cycle, though it wasn’t easy. I applied to a total of 112 companies according to my Notion, and according to my learnings from my previous cycles, literally applied for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that looked interesting to me. These included banks, FAANG, other tech firms, startups, anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of interviews I did helped to keep me warm, as did the leetcode, but it also really told me about the types of companies I really didn’t like. Just as much as an interview is about them evaluating you, you are also evaluating them. Moving forward, I’m pretty sure finance firms/banks ain’t it for me. I really didn’t like GS’s or JPM’s (and a few others) hiring styles. But startups and big tech are still pretty cool, except for some (ahem ByteDance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a total of 5 offers - Apple, Palantir, Worldquant, Munich Re, AMD. I’ve accepted Palantir and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I noticed was that for some reason somehow this year’s replies/rejections/advancement to next round seemed super slow. As I write this in January, I’ve gotten about 5 emails telling me I’ve passed the resume screen - despite applying in October or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I’ve also gotten a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of rejections this year, and for many parts in this cycle I was pretty demoralized. I stopped counting when the rejections hit 40 or so, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I tried to do with my resume:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make my resume more concise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make one for DS/ML roles, and one for SWE roles - their stacks and skillsets are different. For SWE, the focus was more on typical stuff - tech stacks, the product life cycle, etc. For DS, was mostly about the techniques for model development and applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My approach to applications&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind leetcode hard. Previously, I did leetcode only to warm up for interviews. This time, for the first 6 weeks of semester 1, I did 2-3 medium/hards a day. After, I would do 2-3 medium/hards every 2-3 days. Every time it would be timed, and every time I would do it as if I was in an interview. It was exhausting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record my leetcode progress. I kept my leetcode solutions on Notion, tracking how I solved them, the topic, their difficulty, and how much time I took to solve them. This helped to create a bank of solutions and also let me visualize how I was progressing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare a “summary” of myself on Notion explaining my resume Things like how I chose each experience and the key experiences for each. It would help &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; for resume deep dives and HireVues when they were over zoom.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cast the net wide. I applied to anything and everything, figuring that in a looming recession, it was a numbers game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What went well:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leetcode grind made a huge difference. I was generally 100%-ing most hackkeranks - except for Bytedance and Google’s OA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary of myself made my life much easier for interview prep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I could have done better/feedback I got:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume is still quite cluttered and hard to read. At least 2 interviewers appeared to be reading my resume for the first time during the interview and seemed to struggle to digest all the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was told by a friend doing hiring that summaries don’t usually matter to HR or the hiring manager, and instead they look for experiences/familiarity with a certain tech stack they are looking for/general evidence for the character/skills they are looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepared better for theory questions (e.g. explain how the DOM works, how React works, what is RESTful APIs, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply for the one you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want only when you’re sorta warmed up - Stripe was my first interview, and I flunked it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What my resume looks like now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve since revamped my format a little. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the summary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separated skills and projects into separate sections, as hiring managers seem to like to look at tech stacks and langauges and then test you specific parts of those stacks/languages. This might make it easier for them to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally prettified it with a more readable font.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed custom formatting that I forced via drag-and-drop - that might have been screwing with automated resume screening tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some personal thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. I am not that good at algo questions, but god, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;leetcode&lt;/code&gt; really helps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flunked the Google OA and Bytedance’s one I found really hard. Apart from that, regular leetcode was really helpful. Beyond that though, I started to find myself enjoying doing them daily/every other day. It was like a fun getaway where I could plug in my headphones and just do some dumb coding. Was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Prepping for content is helpful&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bytedance grilled me with theory questions I was not prepared for. I will prepare for this going forward. I took CS3219 this semester, though, and it was very helpful to have that bank of knowledge in addition to my own experiences when facing tricky real-world-like interview questions, especially in system design (&lt;a href=&quot;https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty good course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Cast the net wide, it’s a numbers game.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020: 2/28 offers (7.2%), 3/28 (10.7%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2021: 3/68 offers (4.4%), 7/68 (10.3%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2022: 5/112 offers (4.5%), 15/112 (13.9%) got past resume screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this year is skewed since we’re only in January and I’m stopping the count, but still, looking at these numbers and their stable proportions, I can’t help but wonder if it truly is a numbers game. We’re also in a strange time of hiring freezes this and last year, so perhaps that’s also affected what I would have expected to be generally growing proportions of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I will take these insights to cast my net wide and far - apply more, and you’ll probably get more chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Have a good selection criteria and longer-term focus in mind, especially if you don’t know what you want&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, I’m not sure what I want to do longer term. I’m in year 4, and the decision to take my FYP and/or go to grad school. is just around the corner (I’m in a 5 year programme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had these decisions in mind, even as far back as year 2, but generally thought “I’ll figure it out when I get there”. The other thought I had to complete that phrase is “I’ll figure it out when I get there, but &lt;em&gt;for now, I will keep my options open&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two cycles, I have made the very conscious effort to search for and choose opportunies that offer me the most &lt;em&gt;learning value&lt;/em&gt;, but not just in the technical sense, but also in the sense of learning about myself - what I like, what I don’t like, what I’m generally okay with. Let my illustrate the considerations at every juncture to show you what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my first application cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; I was offered Cognicept (full-stack SWE) and DSO (ML engineer). DSO made more sense for a lot of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High learning value: Strong culture of research, plenty of highly educated and really good engineers, interns typically given hard projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds my fundamentals: More focused on ML research, which is the fundamentals of ML (you can’t be a great ML engineer without at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; research experience, in my opinion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicality: Nearer to home (lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit into budding narrative of myself at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my second application cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; I was offered WorldQuant (Quant Researcher), Hypotenuse AI (ML engineer/full-stack SWE), Affable AI (ML engineer). Hypotenuse AI made the most sense, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WorldQuant is a quant shop - a quant researcher’s key output is techniques and math, and they are closer to a data scientist than ML engineer, and I would not be able to pick up good engineering practices/knowledge of how &lt;em&gt;deployment&lt;/em&gt; of ML models works. The latter was something I wanted to learn, having done research in a “sandboxed” environment, as most research is typically first done in. Also, finance… didn’t gel well with what I wanted to do longer term. Took a pay cut to give this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affable AI vs. Hypotenuse AI - both were startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Hypotenuse impressed me for a few reasons - their interviews were &lt;strong&gt;so hard&lt;/strong&gt;, but &lt;strong&gt;really focused on testing me on whether I understood the fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;, before going into higher order assessments. They also did a &lt;em&gt;very, very deep&lt;/em&gt; resume deep dive, and I felt like they were really trying to evaluate me hollistically. Their founder, Josh, was also honest with me about what he expected out of me in terms of working hours and working styles going in, and I appreciated it. The staff also seemed strong - ex-Stripe, ex-Amazon, Stanford/Cambridge grads, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affable AI was a bit older, and generally seemed to be further along their growth path. But the interviews and take home assignments didn’t feel as rigorous as what I thought they should have been. Also, office was further away from me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to do ML engineering work in production, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; full-stack work &lt;em&gt;despite having zero experience&lt;/em&gt; gave me a huge learning opportunity. Granted, it was throwing me into the deep end, but I was really hungry to learn - if I survived, I would have had some experience in ML research, ML engineering and full-stack dev, which would not only help me determine what I liked, but also understand a bit better the entire spectrum of the ML value chain - from the lab, to production, to the user-facing side of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my third application cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; I was offered AMD (Data science), Palantir (SWE), Apple (ML engineer or SWE), WorldQuant (SWE), Munich Re (ML Engineer). Now, this one is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice that 4/5 of these are at “bigger”, or at least, “big-ish” companies. In part, I made this choice because bigger companies are not only “flashy” resume wise, but I’d never been in a truly large organization. Large organizations function differently from smaller ones - they typically have more tooling and layers of abstraction, things may move more quickly in parts and slower in others, and I had not experienced any of it. I wanted to experience it - the challenges that come with &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had some flexibility in choosing - I could choose up to two offers, if I had appropriately arranged my year. Now, I’m going to ETH Zurich the coming semester, and school ends in June. If I intern for 3 months, it cuts into my semester - so choosing to LOA for an internship immediately after that also isn’t a bad idea, if the right chance comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palantir and Apple fit my bills perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palantir will be in London. I have never worked abroad before, and I find their product &lt;em&gt;incredibly interesting&lt;/em&gt;. It was a no brainer to accept them, especially to do SWE work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple would allow me to do ML engineering at a big organization - and I really wanted to do that, too. Apple being a FAANG company also helps to give me some credibility down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might think those were no brainers - in some sense, they were. But I just want to highlight that these two weren’t the highest paying opportunities. I tell myself this, and I will tell all my friends, don’t optimize for pay so early. I think I’m mostly inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/&quot;&gt;this wonderful blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/long-term&quot;&gt;this other one&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d do no justice explaining it here - but the general idea is that I am optimizing for learning &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; early on in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I’ll update this when I’m back. It’s going to be an interesting 2023 for me, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello world!]]></title><description><![CDATA[A new website About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself.

&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself. Why? Honestly, I’m not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about “not being competitive” in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Including blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that’s a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I’ve also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I’m willing to put &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I’ve read a lot of others’ blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I’m not alone going through some of the experiences we share. But most of all, just as I wrote in the first post of my private blog, I like writing. I write a lot better than I speak, and I get a lot more out of my head when I write - and in a much more coherent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it’s not just noise. I do think it’ll be like therapy for me, though, lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
