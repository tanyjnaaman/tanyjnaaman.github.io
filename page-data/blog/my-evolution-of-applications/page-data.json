I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer Science instead, and I've not looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - computer vision, natural language processing, graph machine learning, database systems, distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"1f024fc0-d9ce-549d-beee-8e226b575e71","excerpt":"I came into Computer Science in the middle of year 2 - I had changed my course from mechanical engineering, mostly because I realized I really liked machine…","html":"<p>I came into Computer Science in the middle of year 2 - I had changed my course from mechanical engineering, mostly because I realized I really liked machine learning. But finding jobs haven’t been easy, and I figured I’d share some of the wonderful resources I’ve compiled and little lessons I, too, have learnt.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kenneth’s <a href=\"https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/\">great blog post</a> I learnt how to write my first few resumes, but at the risk of creating slightly duplicated content, I think I want to focus more on the general application process, including my resumes, because I get the sense that resumes are but one part of what is often a very long application process.</p>\n<p>For context: my CS journey started in Y2S2, after changing my course of study. My first internship was <em>very</em> lucky, as I got it through sheer luck via TalentConnect - I interned as an ML engineer at DSO. My second was at a startup called Hypotenuse AI. My third and fourth, both offered at the same time, were at Palantir and Apple respectively.</p>\n<h2>Year 2, Semester 2 (2021)</h2>\n<p>In my own records, I applied to a grand total of 28 different places, with a mix of mechanical engineer, data analytics, UI/UX and ML engineer roles. My background at this point was of a robotics engineer and 0 CS background - I had literally just changed my course of study and not taken a single course. I got 2 offers - a startup called Cognicept, and DSO.</p>\n<p><strong>What I tried to do with my resume:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the general advice and resources compiled in Kenneth’s blog post, linked above.

I was also quite a recluse, and had no idea about the existence of resources like <a href=\"https://t.me/projectintern\">Project Intern</a>.</li>\n<li>I went on LinkedIn and google, searched for ML engineer intern (most of my experience was in robotics engineering, 0 software) and just applied.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>General mistakes I made:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrote a unique resume and cover letter for every application. Cover letters don’t matter, and there “tailoring” a resume by and large wastes time without much benefit. They take <em>way</em> too long for virtually zero benefit.</li>\n<li>Started applying only in February. Everything interesting was gone.</li>\n<li>Did 0 leetcode. To be fair, I was basically an engineering student and had no idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Year 3, Semester 1 &#x26; 2 (2021-2022)</h2>\n<p>Having now gone from 0-1, I felt a little better. I was fortunate that my internship at DSO allowed me to learn quite a lot about machine learning workflows and research. But this time, my aim for this application cycle was on startups. The main reason was the belief that a (good) startup would grow me more as a budding engineer. In this application cycle, I made about 68 applications according to my records - but it’s probably more, seeing as I stopped logging them after a while. I iterated through 2 resume versions.</p>\n<p>I got a total of 3 offers - World Quant, Hypotenuse AI and Affable AI, and took the one at Hypotenuse AI. Their interviews were <em>by far</em> the hardest - it was 3 hours of non-stop grilling. Convinced me that they knew what they were doing and there was high learning value in joining them.</p>\n<p><strong>What I tried to do with my resume:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I made a website/linkedin and added links to them.</li>\n<li>I added a quick summary. I doubt it would work, but also figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to do.</li>\n<li>I added colour for quicker readability/highlight what I thought might be important.</li>\n<li>I added more concrete descriptors (e.g. improve performance by 700x)</li>\n<li>After asking some seniors who did hiring, added a small section on the tech stacks I’d worked with (or figured I could learn fast enough for an interview).</li>\n<li>Removed my JC from my education, since I didn’t need the “filler” anymore.</li>\n<li>Added a project that was my website as a showcase that I could do <em>some</em> frontend dev. I’m still shit at it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/83e77/resume_2022.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 141.89189189189187%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAcCAYAAABh2p9gAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAEdElEQVRIx21W2Y7jNhDU/39SnoJggSBYZDczHh+SrMPWLes+fXeqKMkzwK6ABimabHZXV7WsPZ9PUSa/Ply7Ph5yezyV1eNFLvfHb/fRBx/ttYiDRZ7L+XyWcRzlerlIWdeSVrWcylKyqhI9jCQqShmHXtq2wb5BBsxldkan2h2OmvMFt5/lECfi56X4WSFxWYt3yiTAe5DlmJ8kLgoJ81yte2kqPn/Hb0U/SH+9TRGer1ex00wOcNIMo9T4sR6w4XKVAZu6efxq59tdGff0zKTtpGwaud/vorVdJ9/fVvJjtZaPrS7v6638fP8Qzw8kRVRJkkiSniSKY2Ux3gOkHkSR9H2vEKzrRrwgBARn0QbgZVi22IejGLYjtufJ/kA7ys52xTp6Ynm+6I4rHhwSS2J6KisZEeEFkX4tqErZAXbEpW5b6XFBi5RpDSKYxkG6eZ1jj0i4r+56qZBuj/Xb7SYP1EMbUdWt5YjhHhGlJ0eE7rOauGRJ8YAIu65/sUFVdbYkSSVhcaIYjkfRbgg5RqUMpMQ0HWDnhaFy7MExzcdmWohLAlwSYORcreP3GBj7wPSKKDV63QHDtW7KB2y1MyXEBqbR9ZNxzn0DrAMMDdLkeoXK6ntbZcaR+7QbSh0g7An8AEXx5YibU0TNVBJU+pQXkmTZ9I6xATNqOKubVkoQv8UlHC+oh1JKik1bYy97pL3bW2LOow5sTdtW1deRBdcs9yAZ1EIV0QpUu0Dlc1T+DIForAyj2Jh7bAaOjqMcKIcwwqHPxjXaATjTyD1iHeP8GQRXtCEZme4bSO3HqaIFmT9iAy+jUQGUKKnB+RWp0cgQOo0AGYv0qnIyV9lwDso5q21jjKFXVnmpKi3C2vLO1MldXvIiNotSIKIEGCTAg0bBB6dcgd4A/BaHGhhlSmvmd0apsmAGC7FZ/j/+/CZ//fOvrFB6E5UOcPNx7iQBKhwXU8fxs6nTZNDugHSpJBoVMwA61b5aRPf39x+yUjzciwlOuaBNBEcnHIwZNSiRzCPXOhymZKllGuePpcEOION/H1vZwOEG1HnDnM3iKy6/7+WfD1NPETkrrfFgCDmRIia6y9J5CPpR0SJQVLIOLvhpK86SfzlgIP9YVDpskfYdnweNuevg3fvOkM3ekbUJrvFdNyTErS0lh1bPzwJt+XYsDxWVF5W6iDTSKOgEbd2a+6DpflKHxnkEbZM+jHgh9B77SOhWFWT8pM0TXzPmv4VSTHtSydYknqaCQFcStMWlxuGI3YZw8ILlInYbSu+Kz4NGINmZDdgBlHFhFnqjAR0Ty8VRCDXEMD+MVYrLQ2cnfsiwPlLLlBOV4vq+apJTBPGkiGjqfex77JEO0mfKLuBxYIyOLezxBVeNIGcI15oxowTZbXiYES7GKAl8TGLjc8rI2GlYccrv5ZA9TD/6soaOdzi4Ybp45xePh1RKyIBO2AMrOKD8ns+5acD454A0ulzmlEvwqSCvYBXmGVWSTw2WGxfjOtcqqGXpPtQx6UT6sB7/AwDeQrXvFdysAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"My resume\"\n        title=\"My resume\"\n        src=\"/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/fcda8/resume_2022.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/12f09/resume_2022.png 148w,\n/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/e4a3f/resume_2022.png 295w,\n/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/fcda8/resume_2022.png 590w,\n/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/efc66/resume_2022.png 885w,\n/static/484d7723f7d10039bd7914353b257e84/83e77/resume_2022.png 889w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><strong>My general application strategy</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I aimed for startups as I had a chip on my shoulder and feared rejection, which was likely from bigger companies.</li>\n<li>I was, however, very <em>selective</em> about my startups - they had to have founders/engineers of exceptional ability/track record (e.g. top school, advanced degrees, publications, big tech) and backing by known VCs (e.g. YC).</li>\n<li>I found a good programme called <a href=\"https://www.sginnovate.com/apprenticeship/talent\">Summation</a>, which is backed by the SG government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback I got from friends/interviews and mistakes I made:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resume looked a bit haphazard. Colour was nice, but could be hard to read. Uneven spacing/line lengths made it hard to read. Too much content in general.</li>\n<li>Did not do enough leetcode still, was struggling with hackerranks at medium. Honestly spent too much time chilling/studying for mods.</li>\n<li>Did not apply widely enough. Focused almost entirely on “high success” applications as I was afraid of rejection (e.g. did not apply for FAANG, Indeed &#x26; similar tech firms, or banks/finance).</li>\n<li>Online courses don’t matter for CS kids.</li>\n<li>Make sure links in resume aren’t broken - one of my interviewers tried to see my stuff, but couldn’t.</li>\n<li>Make sure you can be <em>grilled</em> for everything you have on the resume. One of my interviews did a <em>deep, deep</em> dive, and I couldn’t explain some of the work I did/some of the tech stacks (but generally did ok!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some general learning points:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Being very selective about startups was a good idea</strong>. I applied to quite a few - AI Pallete, Affable AI, Polybee, Lauretta.io, Finantier and Hypotenuse AI were the 5 in the Summation Programme. In these, and most of the startup interviews, I felt that they lacked rigour - questions were mostly non-technical in nature. The only ones that were different were Affable AI and Hypotenuse AI - they had challenging take home assignments and interesting technical and system design questions, and generally gave me the sense that they were talented people who knew what they were doing. This is important to me - and I think in general - because the opportunity cost of interning at a startup is not only the pay cut, but the learning opportunity from talented engineers/mentorship. In fast-moving organizations, interning without mentorship sucks.</li>\n<li><strong>Generally got past resume screen for ML/DS related roles.</strong> At those points, generally did well because algos would only be one part of it. A big part of ML/DS interviews are theory heavy, and those require a different type of preparation. Checkout <a href=\"https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/\">Chip Huyen’s</a> and <a href=\"https://rish16.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Bites-7c1675ecb587451e9caf793c68972276\">Rishabh’s</a> excellent resources for those. In contrast, barely got past resume screen for any SWE roles. Which made sense, given I had basically zero SWE dev experience and I think the barrier to entry for SWE roles are much lower, making competition much stiffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Year 4, Semester 1 (2022-2023)</h2>\n<p>Generally, I was quite happy with this application cycle, though it wasn’t easy. I applied to a total of 112 companies according to my Notion, and according to my learnings from my previous cycles, literally applied for <em>everything</em> that looked interesting to me. These included banks, FAANG, other tech firms, startups, anything and everything.</p>\n<p>The sheer number of interviews I did helped to keep me warm, as did the leetcode, but it also really told me about the types of companies I really didn’t like. Just as much as an interview is about them evaluating you, you are also evaluating them. Moving forward, I’m pretty sure finance firms/banks ain’t it for me. I really didn’t like GS’s or JPM’s (and a few others) hiring styles. But startups and big tech are still pretty cool, except for some (ahem ByteDance).</p>\n<p>I got a total of 5 offers - Apple, Palantir, Worldquant, Munich Re, AMD. I’ve accepted Palantir and Apple.</p>\n<p>Something I noticed was that for some reason somehow this year’s replies/rejections/advancement to next round seemed super slow. As I write this in January, I’ve gotten about 5 emails telling me I’ve passed the resume screen - despite applying in October or so.</p>\n<p>That said, I’ve also gotten a <em>ton</em> of rejections this year, and for many parts in this cycle I was pretty demoralized. I stopped counting when the rejections hit 40 or so, lol.</p>\n<p><strong>What I tried to do with my resume:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make my resume more concise.</li>\n<li>Make one for DS/ML roles, and one for SWE roles - their stacks and skillsets are different. For SWE, the focus was more on typical stuff - tech stacks, the product life cycle, etc. For DS, was mostly about the techniques for model development and applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/38af3/resume_2023_SWE.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 141.2162162162162%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"SWE Resume\"\n        title=\"SWE Resume\"\n        src=\"/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/fcda8/resume_2023_SWE.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/12f09/resume_2023_SWE.png 148w,\n/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/e4a3f/resume_2023_SWE.png 295w,\n/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/fcda8/resume_2023_SWE.png 590w,\n/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/efc66/resume_2023_SWE.png 885w,\n/static/3e39563f49e80dc348594ba6d8d94b51/38af3/resume_2023_SWE.png 894w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><strong>My approach to applications</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grind leetcode hard.

Every time it would be timed, and every time I would do it as if I was in an interview. It was exhausting.</li>\n<li>Record my leetcode progress. I kept my leetcode solutions on Notion, tracking how I solved them, the topic, their difficulty, and how much time I took to solve them.

I am not that good at algo questions, but god, <code class=\"language-text\">leetcode</code> really helps</h4>\n<p>I flunked the Google OA and Bytedance’s one I found really hard. Apart from that, regular leetcode was really helpful. Beyond that though, I started to find myself enjoying doing them daily/every other day. It was like a fun getaway where I could plug in my headphones and just do some dumb coding. Was fun.</p>\n<h4>2. Prepping for content is helpful</h4>\n<p>Bytedance grilled me with theory questions I was not prepared for. I will prepare for this going forward. I took CS3219 this semester, though, and it was very helpful to have that bank of knowledge in addition to my own experiences when facing tricky real-world-like interview questions, especially in system design (<a href=\"https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview\">this</a> is a pretty good course).</p>\n<h4>3. Cast the net wide, it’s a numbers game.</h4>\n<p>Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020: 2/28 offers (7.2%), 3/28 (10.7%) got past resume screen.</li>\n<li>2021: 3/68 offers (4.4%), 7/68 (10.3%) got past resume screen.</li>\n<li>2022: 5/112 offers (4.5%), 15/112 (13.9%) got past resume screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maybe this year is skewed since we’re only in January and I’m stopping the count, but still, looking at these numbers and their stable proportions, I can’t help but wonder if it truly is a numbers game. We’re also in a strange time of hiring freezes this and last year, so perhaps that’s also affected what I would have expected to be generally growing proportions of success.</p>\n<p>In either case, I will take these insights to cast my net wide and far - apply more, and you’ll probably get more chances.</p>\n<h4>4. Have a good selection criteria and longer-term focus in mind, especially if you don’t know what you want</h4>\n<p>Even now, I’m not sure what I want to do longer term. I’m in year 4, and the decision to take my FYP and/or go to grad school. is just around the corner (I’m in a 5 year programme).</p>\n<p>I’ve always had these decisions in mind, even as far back as year 2, but generally thought “I’ll figure it out when I get there”. The other thought I had to complete that phrase is “I’ll figure it out when I get there, but <em>for now, I will keep my options open</em>.”</p>\n<p>Over the past two cycles, I have made the very conscious effort to search for and choose opportunies that offer me the most <em>learning value</em>, but not just in the technical sense, but also in the sense of learning about myself - what I like, what I don’t like, what I’m generally okay with. Let my illustrate the considerations at every juncture to show you what I mean.</p>\n<p><strong>In my first application cycle:</strong> I was offered Cognicept (full-stack SWE) and DSO (ML engineer). DSO made more sense for a lot of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High learning value: Strong culture of research, plenty of highly educated and really good engineers, interns typically given hard projects.</li>\n<li>Builds my fundamentals: More focused on ML research, which is the fundamentals of ML (you can’t be a great ML engineer without at least <em>some</em> research experience, in my opinion).</li>\n<li>Practicality: Nearer to home (lol)</li>\n<li>Fit into budding narrative of myself at the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In my second application cycle:</strong> I was offered WorldQuant (Quant Researcher), Hypotenuse AI (ML engineer/full-stack SWE), Affable AI (ML engineer). Hypotenuse AI made the most sense, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WorldQuant is a quant shop - a quant researcher’s key output is techniques and math, and they are closer to a data scientist than ML engineer, and I would not be able to pick up good engineering practices/knowledge of how <em>deployment</em> of ML models works. The latter was something I wanted to learn, having done research in a “sandboxed” environment, as most research is typically first done in. Also, finance… didn’t gel well with what I wanted to do longer term. Took a pay cut to give this up.</li>\n<li>Affable AI vs. Hypotenuse AI - both were startups.</li>\n<li>But Hypotenuse impressed me for a few reasons - their interviews were <strong>so hard</strong>, but <strong>really focused on testing me on whether I understood the fundamentals</strong>, before going into higher order assessments. They also did a <em>very, very deep</em> resume deep dive, and I felt like they were really trying to evaluate me hollistically. Their founder, Josh, was also honest with me about what he expected out of me in terms of working hours and working styles going in, and I appreciated it. The staff also seemed strong - ex-Stripe, ex-Amazon, Stanford/Cambridge grads, etc.</li>\n<li>Affable AI was a bit older, and generally seemed to be further along their growth path. But the interviews and take home assignments didn’t feel as rigorous as what I thought they should have been. Also, office was further away from me.</li>\n<li>Being able to do ML engineering work in production, <em>and</em> full-stack work <em>despite having zero experience</em> gave me a huge learning opportunity. Granted, it was throwing me into the deep end, but I was really hungry to learn - if I survived, I would have had some experience in ML research, ML engineering and full-stack dev, which would not only help me determine what I liked, but also understand a bit better the entire spectrum of the ML value chain - from the lab, to production, to the user-facing side of things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In my third application cycle:</strong> I was offered AMD (Data science), Palantir (SWE), Apple (ML engineer or SWE), WorldQuant (SWE), Munich Re (ML Engineer). Now, this one is more complicated.</p>\n<p>You might notice that 4/5 of these are at “bigger”, or at least, “big-ish” companies. In part, I made this choice because bigger companies are not only “flashy” resume wise, but I’d never been in a truly large organization. Large organizations function differently from smaller ones - they typically have more tooling and layers of abstraction, things may move more quickly in parts and slower in others, and I had not experienced any of it. I wanted to experience it - the challenges that come with <em>scale</em>.</p>\n<p>I also had some flexibility in choosing - I could choose up to two offers, if I had appropriately arranged my year. Now, I’m going to ETH Zurich the coming semester, and school ends in June. If I intern for 3 months, it cuts into my semester - so choosing to LOA for an internship immediately after that also isn’t a bad idea, if the right chance comes along.</p>\n<p>Palantir and Apple fit my bills perfectly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palantir will be in London. I have never worked abroad before, and I find their product <em>incredibly interesting</em>. It was a no brainer to accept them, especially to do SWE work.</li>\n<li>Apple would allow me to do ML engineering at a big organization - and I really wanted to do that, too. Apple being a FAANG company also helps to give me some credibility down the line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, you might think those were no brainers - in some sense, they were. But I just want to highlight that these two weren’t the highest paying opportunities. I tell myself this, and I will tell all my friends, don’t optimize for pay so early. I think I’m mostly inspired by <a href=\"https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/\">this wonderful blog post</a> and <a href=\"https://nav.al/long-term\">this other one</a>, and I’d do no justice explaining it here - but the general idea is that I am optimizing for learning <em>rate</em> early on in my career.</p>\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\n<p>I don’t know. I’ll update this when I’m back. It’s going to be an interesting 2023 for me, I think.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My evolution of applications (and resumes)","date":"January 12, 2023","description":"Kenneth did one, and I figured I'd do one too.
