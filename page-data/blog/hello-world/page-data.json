Honestly, I’m not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about “not being competitive” in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.</p>\n<h2>Including blogs</h2>\n<p>Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that’s a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I’ve also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I’m willing to put <em>out there</em>, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I’ve read a lot of others’ blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I’m not alone going through some of the experiences we share. </p>\n<p>So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it’s not just noise. I do think it’ll be like therapy for me, though, lol.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello world!","date":"December 28, 2022","description":"So, I decided to build a new website."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My own evolution of resumes"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
