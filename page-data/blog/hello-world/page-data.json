I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer Science instead, and I've not looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - computer vision, natural language processing, graph machine learning, database/retrieval systems, parallel & distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"e0c08c30-0b74-5286-99d5-0d23f66f589b","excerpt":"A new website About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself.

Honestly, I’m not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about “not being competitive” in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.</p>\n<h2>Including blogs</h2>\n<p>Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that’s a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I’ve also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I’m willing to put <em>out there</em>, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I’ve read a lot of others’ blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I’m not alone going through some of the experiences we share. But most of all, just as I wrote in the first post of my private blog, I like writing. I write a lot better than I speak, and I get a lot more out of my head when I write - and in a much more coherent fashion.</p>\n<p>So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it’s not just noise. I do think it’ll be like therapy for me, though, lol.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello world!","date":"January 05, 2023","description":"So, I decided to build a new website."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-evolution-of-applications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An N=1 sample of my journey through tech"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
