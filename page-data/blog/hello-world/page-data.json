I'm a final year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore. I'm currently interning as a ML engineer at Apple.\n    I spend most of my time these days bouncing between my internship work at Apple and my research work with Ryan Cotterel's group at ETH Zurich on Large Language Model Evaluation. Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.\n    I'm always looking for fun and interesting projects to work on, so feel free to reach out to me and let's build something together.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OcgXS-xHgBX1oufavyKkkMnK6CN6ur3I/view?usp=sharing"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"e0c08c30-0b74-5286-99d5-0d23f66f589b","excerpt":"A new website About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I’d build a website for myself.

Honestly, I’m not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about “not being competitive” in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.</p>\n<h2>Including blogs</h2>\n<p>Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that’s a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I’ve also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I’m willing to put <em>out there</em>, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I’ve read a lot of others’ blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I’m not alone going through some of the experiences we share. </p>\n<p>So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it’s not just noise. I do think it’ll be like therapy for me, though, lol.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello world!","date":"December 28, 2022","description":"So, I decided to build a new website."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/relfecting-on-leaving-mech-engineering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reflecting on leaving mechanical engineering, two years later"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
