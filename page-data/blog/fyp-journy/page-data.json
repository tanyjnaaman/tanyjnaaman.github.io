I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer Science instead, and I've not looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - natural language processing, database/retrieval systems, parallel & distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"e74ba475-0696-5422-b1ce-c18986ae554a","excerpt":"","html":"<details closed>\n<summary><b>The first log (written 3 June)</b></summary>\n<br>\n</details>","frontmatter":{"title":"Documenting my final year project on language model control and evaluation","date":"June 03, 2023","description":"a lot of things"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/fyp-journy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-exchange-begins/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I went on exchange"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
