I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer Science instead, and I've not looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - natural language processing, database/retrieval systems, parallel & distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"e1c44c32-18a7-5b38-a23c-793c1b132cdb","excerpt":"Blogs I check out Yi Tay Shreya Shankar Rishahb Anand David Mueller Nato Lambert Sandar Dieleman Stuff in general Startups will ruin your life in the best way…","html":"<h2>Blogs I check out</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yitay.net/\">Yi Tay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shreya-shankar.com/\">Shreya Shankar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/\">Rishahb Anand</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://damueller.com/#/blog\">David Mueller</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.natolambert.com/writing\">Nato Lambert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sander.ai/posts/\">Sandar Dieleman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stuff in general</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reading.supply/@mathemakitten/startups-will-ruin-your-life-in-the-best-way-sW7aZt\">Startups will ruin your life in the best way</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/\">Evolution of resumes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrisjwelly.github.io/blog/2022/01/05/Career-Progression-CS3230-TA/\">Career progression: CS3230 TA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.effectiveengineer.com/blog/established-company-vs-promising-startup\">The One Important Thing to Consider When Deciding Where to Work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau\">What are mistakes which software engineers make in their early years?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/\">On being a senior engineer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nav.al/long-term\">Play Long-term Games With Long-term People</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ML and research stuff</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yitay.net/blog/emergence-and-scaling\">On emergent abilities, scaling architectures and LLMs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yitay.net/blog/2022-best-nlp-papers\">2022 in Review: Top language AI research papers + interesting papers to read</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rish-16.github.io/posts/gnn-math/\">Math behind GNNs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://damueller.com/#/blog-post/NNLLs\">Neural Network Loss Landscapes: What do we know?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ML career stuff</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rlblogging.notion.site/Personal-Rules-of-Productive-Research-44a456bacf7c4805a9ea417b9d3ab1b3\">Personal Rules of Productive Research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shreya-shankar.com/making-ml-work/\">Reflecting on a Year of Making Machine Learning Actually Useful</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.natolambert.com/writing/ai-phd-job-hunt\">Job Hunt as a PhD in AI / ML / RL: How it Actually Happens</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Readings I come  back to","date":"January 30, 2023","description":"Just a collection of blog posts I enjoyed"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/some-blog-posts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/reflections-on-being-a-ta/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Teaching CS2040 and CS3244 was not quite what I expected"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/dropping-economics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I'm dropping my second degree"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
