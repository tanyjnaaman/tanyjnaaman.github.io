I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer science instead, and I've never looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - computer vision, natural language processing, graph machine learning, database systems, distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Beyond computer science, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"Two years ago Just over two years ago, it was the December of 2020.
