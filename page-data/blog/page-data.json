I'm a final year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore. I'm currently interning as a ML engineer at Apple.\n    I spend most of my time these days bouncing between my internship work at Apple and my research work with Ryan Cotterel's group at ETH Zurich on Large Language Model Evaluation. Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.\n    I'm always looking for fun and interesting projects to work on, so feel free to reach out to me and let's build something together.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OcgXS-xHgBX1oufavyKkkMnK6CN6ur3I/view?usp=sharing"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"Last year, I spent half a year in Zurich at ETH, and in the second class of Ryan Cotterell’s excellent Large Language Models course I walked…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-first-paper/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 14, 2024","title":"My first paper","description":"After a long year"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"But it’s been so good!
