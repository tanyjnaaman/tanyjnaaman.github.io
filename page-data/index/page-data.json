I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Economics at the National University of Singapore.\n      I used to study engineering. But three unhappy semesters and a couple of robotics projects convinced me to take a leap of faith and study Computer Science instead, and I've not looked back since. I've spent a lot of my time in university focused on deep learning systems and its adjacent fields - natural language processing, database/retrieval systems, parallel & distributed systems etc., and I think it's pretty neat.\n      Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, playing badminton and watching movies.","author":"","email":"tannaaman@u.nus.edu","github":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyjnaaman/","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nn3kwaH1fpHfHhJzDk2OdnAj4D9M0Ziu/view?usp=share_link","projects":[{"name":"NUS Notes and Reviews (Ongoing)","description":"A collection of my notes and reviews of the classes I take at NUS.","link":"https://github.com/tanyjnaaman/NUS-notes-and-reviews"},{"name":"Oxford Map The System 2021","description":"Led an interdiscplinary team of 5 to investigate how meritocracy in Singapore worsens inequality with a systems thinking approach.
